Question 1:
Can I take more than the recommended number of courses in a semester?

Answer:
## 📌 Direct Answer (Quick Summary)
Yes, you can take more than the recommended number of courses per semester, but you need approval from your academic advisor or the Associate Dean, depending on the extent of the overload.

### Key Points
• **Approval Required:** You must get approval from your academic advisor to take more than the standard course load. For significant overloads, approval from the Associate Dean of Education may be necessary.
• **Specific Limits and Requirements:** For CS students, the standard full load is 54 units, with an overload limit of 63 units. Tepper students have an overload threshold of 51 units.
• **Academic Performance:** You need a minimum QPA of 3.0 (CS students) or 3.5 (Tepper students) to be eligible for an overload.

### Detailed Explanation
Overloading courses means taking more units than the typical full load for a semester. Each department has specific guidelines and thresholds for overloading:
- **CS Students:** The normal full load is 54 units, and you can overload up to 63 units with your advisor’s approval. If you wish to exceed this limit, you'll need the approval of the Associate Dean of Education. You must have completed at least 45 factorable units in the previous semester with a QPA above 3.0.
- **Tepper Students:** The overload threshold is 51 units, and you need a cumulative QPA of 3.5 to petition for an overload.

### What You Should Do / Next Steps
1. **Check Your Eligibility:** Ensure you meet the QPA requirement and have completed the necessary units in the previous semester.
2. **Consult Your Advisor:** Discuss your academic plan and reasons for wanting to overload. Your advisor can provide guidance and help assess if you can manage the additional workload.
3. **Obtain Approval:** If your advisor agrees, they will need to approve your course overload. For substantial overloads, additional approval from the Associate Dean may be required.
4. **Register for Courses:** Once approved, proceed with course registration, keeping in mind any prerequisites or restrictions for new courses.

By following these steps and consulting with your academic advisor, you can effectively manage an increased course load while maintaining your academic performance.
