================================================================================
❓ CLARIFICATION NEEDED
================================================================================

   🤔 Why I need to ask:
      The ability to take more than the recommended number of courses can vary significantly based on the student's major or program, as different programs have different workload expectations and policies. Additionally, the student's current semester/year is crucial to understand if they are in a position to handle an increased course load, and their academic standing might affect eligibility for overloading. Knowing courses already completed is necessary to check for prerequisites and assess if the student is prepared for advanced courses.

   Query: "Can I take a graduate-level course as an undergraduate?"
   💭 Context: 3 previous turn(s) in conversation

   Analyzing query to determine which agents are needed...
⚠️  Clarification check error: Request timed out.

   🧠 LLM-Driven Coordination (Full Reasoning)
   📊 Priority: high
   🎯 Confidence: ████████ (0.85)

   🔍 Problem Understanding:
      • Goal: The student wants to know if they are eligible to enroll in a graduate-level course while being an undergraduate.
      • Concern: The student may be looking to advance their knowledge or fulfill specific academic requirements more efficiently.

   🎯 Coordination Goal:
      To provide the student with a clear and comprehensive understanding of whether they can enroll in a graduate-level course as an undergraduate, including any necessary steps or conditions.

   💭 Reasoning:
      The workflow is designed to first confirm policy compliance to ensure the student's request is permissible under university regulations. Following this, detailed course information is gathered to address any specific prerequisites or permissions.

   🤖 Agent Analysis:

      • policy_compliance: high priority

   💭 Agent's Contribution:
   Yes, as an undergraduate junior or senior, you can take a graduate-level
   course, provided it is open to undergraduate students. Based on the
   context provided, the course numbers 08534 and 05436 are available for
   juniors, seniors, and master's students. These courses have less
   demanding project and presentation requirements compared to the
   PhD-level courses. You will need to register for the class during the
   semester you intend to complete it, no later than your penultimate
   semester. Additionally, you may need special permission to enroll,
   especially if the course is intended for students who have declared a
   general studies major. It would be best to contact the instructors for
   permission to enroll.

   💭 Agent's Contribution:
   Yes, as an undergraduate, you can take a graduate-level course, but you
   will likely need to obtain approval from your academic advisor or
   department. It's important to consult with your advisor to ensure that
   you meet any prerequisites and that the course fits into your academic
   plan. Additionally, you may need to consider the implications on your
   course load and ensure you have the necessary permissions if you are
   planning to exceed the normal course load.

💡 FINAL ADVISOR RESPONSE
================================================================================

## 📌 Direct Answer
Yes, as an undergraduate, particularly if you are a junior or senior, you can enroll in a graduate-level course. However, you will need special permission and must meet certain prerequisites.

### Key Points
• **Eligibility:** Primarily open to juniors and seniors.
• **Permission Required:** You must obtain approval from your academic advisor or department.
• **Course Registration:** Enroll during the semester you plan to take the course, ideally no later than your penultimate semester.

### Detailed Explanation
Undergraduates, especially those in their junior or senior years, have the opportunity to take graduate-level courses. This is contingent on the courses being open to undergraduates and often requires special permissions to ensure that the student meets the academic prerequisites and that the course aligns with their academic goals. Courses numbered 08534 and 05436, for example, are structured to accommodate both master’s students and upper-level undergraduates, with adjusted requirements less demanding than those in PhD-level courses.

### What You Should Do / Next Steps
1. **Consult Your Advisor:** Discuss how the graduate course fits into your academic plan and verify you meet the prerequisites.
2. **Contact the Instructor:** Seek permission to enroll in the course, as this is often necessary.
3. **Register for the Course:** Ensure you do this during the designated registration period for the semester you intend to take the course.

By following these steps, you can enhance your academic experience by taking on graduate-level coursework while still an undergraduate.
