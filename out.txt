Question 2:
As a Biological Science student, I want to use a voucher to change my final course grade to pass/no pass in Honors Modern Bio. Can I do that? Until when can I still submit my voucher? If I pass the course, should I still retake it?

Answer:
## 📌 Direct Answer (Quick Summary)
Yes, you can use a voucher to change your final course grade in Honors Modern Bio to pass/no pass. The deadline to submit your voucher is **before 12:00 p.m. on the day prior to the last day of classes**. If Honors Modern Bio is a required course for your major, you will need to retake it for a letter grade to fulfill your major requirements.

### Key Points
• **Deadline:** Submit your voucher by **12:00 p.m. on the day before the last day of classes**.
• **Major Requirement:** If Honors Modern Bio is required for your major, a pass/no pass grade will not count, and you must retake the course for a letter grade.

### Detailed Explanation
As a Biological Science student, you have the option to change your course grade to pass/no pass using a voucher. This can be done up until the last day of classes each semester. However, it's important to note that courses taken under the pass/no pass option do not count towards major or minor requirements. This means if Honors Modern Bio is essential for your major, taking it as pass/no pass will not fulfill the requirement, and you would need to retake the course to earn a qualifying letter grade.

### What You Should Do / Next Steps
1. **Decide if Changing to Pass/No Pass is Right for You:** Consider if you need a letter grade for Honors Modern Bio for your major or future academic goals.
2. **Submit the Voucher:** If you choose to proceed, ensure you submit the voucher by the specified deadline.
3. **Plan Accordingly:** If required for your major, plan to retake the course for a letter grade in a future semester.
4. **Consult Your Advisor:** Discuss your decision and any concerns with your academic advisor to ensure it aligns with your academic and career goals.
