    "Description": "The Minor in Financial Management, offered by the Undergraduate Tepper School of Business, develops students’ skills in financial analysis, valuation, and quantitative decision-making. Core courses cover corporate finance and financial modeling, as well as probability and statistics for business applications, complemented by foundational economics or data reasoning. Through a selection of advanced electives—from international finance and investment analysis to financial statement analysis, corporate finance, macroeconomics, blockchain business, and mathematical finance—students tailor their studies to emerging sectors and global markets. Emphasizing hands-on modeling, data-driven insights, and strategic problem-solving, this minor prepares graduates for careers in banking, consulting, asset management, fintech, and corporate strategy. Only one minor course may overlap with other major or minor requirements, and students must complete all required courses plus three electives from the list.",
