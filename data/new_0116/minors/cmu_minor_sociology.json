    "Description": "The Sociology minor introduces the student to central concepts in sociological theory and methods of empirical inquiry needed to broadly understand social behavior, including its structure, history, and dynamics. Students choose among a range of methodological approaches and substantive topic areas including social psychology, work and organizations, social networks, technology and society, medical sociology, and gender and family. Exposure to these topics will help students understand and appreciate the processes by which families, groups, and organizations form and evolve over time; by which individuals affect and are affected by the society in which they live; and by which technology and institutions shape and influence society. This background in empirical tools and social theory will strengthen the student’s ability to pursue graduate studies in sociology, social history, social science, and organizational theory; to begin professional careers involving social analysis, network analysis, data analysis of teams, groups and organizations, social analysis within journalism, political institutions, the government, and online; and to enter the corporate environment with a thorough understanding of organizational activity.",
    "Notes": "Complete four courses (a minimum of 36 units) from the following list. Two courses (18 units) must be taken from one category to complete the depth requirement. One course (9 units) must be taken from the other category. The remaining course (9 units) may be taken from either category. Appropriate courses offered by the Department of Sociology at the University of Pittsburgh (available during the academic year through cross-registration) may also be included as part of this option. Contact the Sociology program advisor for more information. The core courses are offered regularly; the elective courses are offered with at least general regularity. Participating departments may subsequently develop and offer other courses that, while not listed here, are deemed appropriate for this minor. The program advisor should be consulted (especially when the schedule of courses to be offered for a given semester becomes available) to identify such additional courses. No more than two courses (18 units) in the Sociology minor may be counted to fulfill any other major or minor's requirements."
