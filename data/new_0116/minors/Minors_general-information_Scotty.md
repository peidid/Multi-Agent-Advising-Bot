Arabic Studies

The minor in Arabic Studies promotes not just language proficiency but also an understanding of Arabic culture. Students must have an Advanced-level proficiency in the Arabic language. CMU-Q students who need elementary and intermediate level courses should consult with the campus advisor for Arabic Studies before declaring the minor. Student progress may be accelerated or supplemented by study abroad.

Students may double count one course taken for the Arabic Studies minor that are also being used to fulfill the requirements of other majors, minors, and programs. This does not include double-counting with General Education requirements, which has no limit.

Students with native or near-native proficiency in listening and speaking of the language prior to entering CMU should consult with the minor advisors for a different curriculum that may accelerate their completion of the requirement.

Computational Biology

Computational Biology is concerned with solving biological and biomedical problems using mathematical and computational methods. It is recognized as an essential element in modern biological and biomedical research. There have been fundamental changes in biology and medicine over the past two decades due to spectacular advances in high throughput data collection for genomics, proteomics and biomedical imaging. The resulting availability of unprecedented amounts of biological data demands the application of advanced computational tools to build integrated models of biological systems, and to use them to devise methods of prevent or treat disease. Computational Biologists inhabit and expand the interface of computation and biology, making them integral to the future of biology and medicine.

Sociology

The Sociology minor introduces the student to central concepts in sociological theory and methods of empirical inquiry needed to broadly understand social behavior, including its structure, history, and dynamics. Students choose among a range of methodological approaches and substantive topic areas including social psychology, work and organizations, social networks, technology and society, medical sociology, and gender and family. Exposure to these topics will help students understand and appreciate the processes by which families, groups, and organizations form and evolve over time; by which individuals affect and are affected by the society in which they live; and by which technology and institutions shape and influence society. This background in empirical tools and social theory will strengthen the student’s ability to pursue graduate studies in sociology, social history, social science, and organizational theory; to begin professional careers involving social analysis, network analysis, data analysis of teams, groups and organizations, social analysis within journalism, political institutions, the government, and online; and to enter the corporate environment with a thorough understanding of organizational activity.
