## **Internship opportunities for Bio Sci students**

Bio Sci students can apply and take advantage of many research internship opportunities in renowned universities and research centers in Qatar and around the world. These internship programs are highly competitive and students from our program have successfully secured internship positions in the past. Students who are interested in applying are encouraged to discuss their plans with their academic advisor.

#### **Internship opportunities in Qatar:**

Both Weill Cornell and HBKU offer summer internship programs.

-   QBRI offers internship opportunities tailored for outstanding schools, undergraduate, and graduate students, specifically focusing on research related to diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders. As an intern, they will have a unique chance to connect with new individuals, delve into exciting areas of scientific research, and gain firsthand experience in biomedical research protocols and techniques. Additionally, QBRI hosts the annual Summer Research Program (SRP), which offers intensive research training for undergraduate students. You can find more details about the SRP by [clicking here](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/QBRI/SRP). Moreover, we extend shadowing opportunities, allowing students to visit QBRI labs for one or more days to shadow our researchers. This arrangement can be made through the university’s coordinator Dania Makki ([dmakki@andrew.cmu.edu](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/summer-internship/dmakki@andrew.cmu.edu)). For internship inquiries, students can reach out to us directly at [qbriinfo@hbku.edu.qa](mailto:qbriinfo@hbku.edu.qa). Please be aware that internship durations can range from a minimum of one week to up to two months.
-   Details about WCM-Qatar’s internship program will be made available to you once they are shared with us.
-   **Hamad Medical Corporation:** Summer internships and Summer Research Experiences. Interested students can contact Dania Makki ([dmakki@andrew.cmu.edu](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/summer-internship/dmakki@andrew.cmu.edu))by early March at the latest to submit their resume + required forms to be considered for the internship.
-   **Teach for Qatar:** Summer internships. Email Dania Makki ([dmakki@andrew.cmu.edu](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/summer-internship/dmakki@andrew.cmu.edu)) for more information.

#### **Internship opportunities Abroad:**

Students interested in internship experiences abroad must start preparing for their applications sooner. It is important to know that international internships have different deadlines, durations, eligibilities, and requirements. Most offer a stipend and arrange for housing, but few cover travel expenses and insurance. Once you secure an internship, reach out to the Director of Experiential Education Lubna Barghouti (lubnab[@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:lubnab@andrew.cmu.edu)), so that CMUQ can keep contact with you during your travel and internship. 

Please find below a list of internships in different science fields and in different institutions abroad. Please check the eligibility conditions and deadlines:
