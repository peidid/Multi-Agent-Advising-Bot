Despite a lot of research, Breast cancer remains one of the most devastating diseases for women in the world as well as in Qatar, where the age-standardized rate is 36.8 per 100,000 according to the World Health Organization (2020). More importantly, breast cancer is the leading cause of mortality in females amongst all cancers in Qatar. While much has been done to profile gene expression (at the transcript/exon level) in breast cancer compared to non-cancer cells, and some effort has been done to identify post-transcriptional alterations such as in splicing in breast cancer, these efforts fall short of correlating splicing changes to the complexity of breast cancer subtypes. This is particularly significant as mounting evidence shows that each subtype has its unique molecular characteristics that are consequential to prognosis and therapeutical outcomes.

A key step in gene expression is the splicing of introns, which are present in >97% of genes in complex eukaryotes. Mutations that lead to splicing aberrations are responsible for ~15% of inherited diseases and defects in the splicing machinery cause a wide range of ailments. Alternative splicing, which allows for the expression of many isoforms with different coding potential from a single gene, contributes significantly to cellular complexity in eukaryotes. Indeed, ~95% of multiexon human genes undergo alternative splicing. Not surprisingly, cancer cells utilize alternative splicing to dramatically alter the output of many oncogenes and tumor suppressors.

While >200,000 introns in humans are spliced by the canonical spliceosome, there are ~700 “minor” introns that are spliced by a less abundant minor spliceosome. Minor introns are highly conserved and are present in essential genes of diverse cellular functions. However, early data suggested that minor introns are generally poorly spliced, providing a disadvantage for the genes that harbor them and making their purpose and remarkable conservation a mystery.

Our research group is one of the few in the world that investigates minor intron splicing, which despite being very important remains understudied. Our research has pointed to minor intron splicing as a limiting factor in the expression of hundreds of essential genes with functions that are critical to cancer development and progression. Our lab aims to build upon that knowledge and go beyond it by profiling splicing, in general, and minor intron splicing, in particular, in different subtypes of breast cancer. Our approach looks at cell lines established from patients with different subtypes of breast cancer as well as sequencing data from >1200 breast cancer patient samples. We created several easy to interrogate databases that not only include expression and splicing analysis, but also investigate the role of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in altering minor intron splicing in breast cancer. Finally, we aim to explore the deregulation of minor intron splicing in a specific set of minor intron-containing genes, namely DNA damage repair machinery. The data generated yield a much better understanding of how minor intron splicing plays a key role in breast cancer. One of the most significant findings from these projects was discovering that the minor intron in a very well-studied tumor suppressor gene is inefficiently spliced in breast cancer, causing the tumor suppressor to be under-expressed. However, to our surprise, we also discovered that this inefficiently spliced minor intron can be processed into a noncoding RNA that has an independent function of the protein product. This is surprising, because this gene has been studied for decades and work from this project was the first time this molecular process was discovered. This speaks to the power of the molecular profiling approach that is unique and different from what has been done so far.

Students’ projects in the Younis lab fall broadly under one of these:

Characterize alternative splicing in different subtypes of breast cancer.

Characterize intronic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and intergenic lncRNAs in breast cancer.

Identify novel targetable minor introns in breast cancer.

**Eutectic Solvents as Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing**

Overview of Antimicrobial Resistance

The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents one of the greatest challenges to modern medicine. Bacteria, especially those in healthcare settings, have evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms that render many conventional antibiotics ineffective. This is particularly concerning with hospital-acquired infections (nosocomial infections), where resistant bacteria can have devastating consequences, especially for immunocompromised patients.

A class of particularly dangerous pathogens is known by the acronym **ESKAPE**: _Enterococcus faecium_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Acinetobacter baumannii_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Enterobacter spp._ These bacteria exhibit resistance to a wide variety of antibiotics, leading to the emergence of “superbugs” such as methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant _Enterobacteriaceae_ (CRE). The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that without innovative solutions, the world could enter a “post-antibiotic era” in which even minor infections could once again prove fatal.

Despite significant research, most new antibiotics currently under development are not expected to be effective against these resistant pathogens. This dire situation has motivated scientists to explore alternative strategies, including **antibiotic-adjuvant therapy**, a novel approach in which a non-bactericidal compound (the adjuvant) is combined with an antibiotic to enhance its efficacy. These combinations offer a way to revive the potency of older antibiotics while keeping costs lower than traditional drug combination therapies.

#### Novel Strategies in Antimicrobial Research: The Role of Eutectic Solvents

One exciting frontier in this field is the use of **eutectic solvents (DESs)** as drug delivery molecules for antimicrobial agents. DESs are gaining attention due to their ability to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Eutectic solvents are formed by combining two or more components that, when mixed, lower each other’s melting point to create a solvent with unique properties. These solvents are particularly interesting in pharmaceutical applications because of their biocompatibility, low toxicity, and ability to act as solubilizers for poorly soluble drugs.

In the context of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), DESs could transform how antibiotics and antibiotic-adjuvant combinations are delivered and tested for effectiveness. By improving the solubility of certain compounds, eutectic solvents can increase the availability of antimicrobial agents, enhancing their ability to penetrate bacterial cells and overcome common bacterial defense mechanisms like efflux pumps.

**Efflux pumps** are proteins found in bacterial cell membranes that expel a wide variety of harmful substances, including antibiotics, from the bacterial cell. These pumps play a critical role in the development of multidrug resistance. By increasing the intracellular concentration of antibiotics through the use of DESs, the function of efflux pumps can be inhibited, making bacteria more susceptible to treatment.

#### Specific Focus: Flavonoids and Berberine in Combination with Eutectic Solvents

The research specifically explores the use of plant-derived natural products, such as **flavonoids** and **berberine**, in combination with antibiotics to combat resistant bacterial strains. Flavonoids are a class of polyphenolic compounds found in many fruits, vegetables, and plants. They have been shown to exhibit various biological activities, including antimicrobial properties. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid derived from plants like _Berberis vulgaris_, has long been used in traditional medicine for its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.

The central hypothesis driving this research is that a **three-way synergy** can be achieved between:

1.  An antibiotic,
2.  A natural product (such as a flavonoid or berberine), and
3.  A eutectic solvent.

By combining these three components, the aim is to potentiate the antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic beyond what could be achieved with standard formulations. Preliminary studies suggest that DESs can help solubilize flavonoids and berberine, increasing their bioavailability and enhancing their antimicrobial efficacy when combined with conventional antibiotics.

### Research Goals

The primary research aims are:

1.  **To investigate the use of eutectic solvents in enhancing the solubility and stability of antimicrobial agents**: This includes traditional antibiotics, flavonoids, and natural products like berberine.
2.  **To explore the potential synergistic effects of eutectic solvent-based formulations on bacterial growth inhibition**: Specifically, determining whether these combinations can effectively overcome bacterial defense mechanisms such as efflux pumps, which are ubiquitous in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
3.  **To test DES-based combination therapies against resistant bacterial strains**: By comparing the efficacy of standard antimicrobial formulations to those containing DESs, novel therapeutic strategies may be identified to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens like MRSA, VRE, and CRE.

### Potential Applications of This Research

The potential applications of this research extend beyond antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The use of eutectic solvents as drug delivery molecules could lead to:

-   **Improved formulations for existing antibiotics**, reviving their clinical usefulness against resistant strains.
-   **Development of novel combination therapies** that are more effective at lower doses, reducing the risk of side effects and the likelihood of promoting further resistance.
-   **A broader understanding of how natural products like flavonoids and berberine interact with antibiotics** and how these interactions can be enhanced through novel drug delivery systems.

**Biological mechanisms of mammalian aging**

‘Everything in the universe ages, including the universe’.

Background: A fundamental question in human biology is why and how do we age? What are the underlying biological mechanisms of aging and is it possible to ‘slow down’ the aging process to potentially increase health span, lifespan, or both. Leonard Hayflick’s seminal work lay the foundation for aging research and made it common knowledge that cells have a limited capacity to proliferate. He discovered that cells stopped proliferating after approximately 50 population-doublings (Hayflick limit) and became aged (aka senescent) (they couldn’t proliferate anymore!). Scientists now know that this senescent phenotype occurs because telomeres shorten after each round of cell division and once the critical limit is reached, the cell becomes senescent (_Nobel Prize, 2009_). Importantly, scientists also discovered that cells show signs of premature or accelerated aging in conditions like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cancer (_Raffaella Di Micco et al., Nature Reviews, 2020_). This is due to exposure to cellular stress factors like DNA damage, mutations, mitochondrial DNA damage, and oxidative stress. Prematurely aged cells also show signs of inflammation, and they secrete many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (_Audrey Lasry et al., Trends in Immunology, 2015_). This is an important finding because scientists are now working on the idea that if we can find strategies to reduce inflammation in prematurely aged cells, then this may reverse the premature senescence phenotype and be potentially therapeutic in conditions like diabetes and cancer.     

Research program: Danger-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) are key components of the immune system and examples include molecules like ATP and ADP, which are secreted by stressed (dying, infected etc.) cells to request help from the immune system. DAMPs signal to the immune system via specific DAMP receptors (P2X and P2Y receptors, for example). As a scientist at Weill Cornell Medicine – Qatar (WCM-Q), I was awarded 2 Undergraduate Research Experience Program (UREP) grants by QNRF. My students and I discovered and published that prematurely aged preadipocytes and cancer cells expressed very high levels of DAMP receptors. These DAMP receptors, when activated by DAMPs, increased the secretion of interleukin-6 – a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (_Yasser Majeed et al., British Journal of Pharmacology, 2022_). At CMU-Q, my research program will build on this discovery. We will identify the pro-inflammatory DAMP receptors at the molecular level, then test the anti-inflammatory potential of inhibitors targeting these receptors to potentially discover novel pharmacological tools that may reverse inflammation in prematurely senescent cells in the context of diabetes and cancer.

**Research Interest:** Investigating PARP inhibition in colorectal cancer cell lines and combinatorial approaches to improve sensitivity

**Description:** Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, accounting for the fourth most common cancer globally and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. In Qatar, it is the third most common cancer when accounting for both sexes, and is also a common cause of cancer-related mortality. Despite recent advances in therapeutic modalities, the current treatment options and benefits for advanced CRC remains limited.

Maintenance of genomic integrity is crucial for the normal physiological function of cells, and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an enzyme that enables DNA damage repair to uphold genomic stability. The principle of PARP inhibition (PARPi) relies on the presence of a defective DNA damage response (DDR) in cancer cells, to elicit excessive genomic and mitotic aberrations, thus favoring cell death. For example, cancer cells with key driver mutations, such as the defective _BRCA1/2,_ rely on PARP-mediated repair mechanisms for survival and hence, PARP inhibition triggers lethality in these cancer cells. PARP inhibitors, such as Olaparib and Talazoparib, have been approved by the Food and Drug administration (FDA) for treatment of ovarian and breast cancers, and more recently in prostate and pancreatic cancers, with _BRCA1/2_ mutations, particularly in the advanced metastatic setting. More recently, numerous studies have observed broadened clinical utility of PARPi in tumors with alternative defects in DNA damage repair, irrespective of the _BRCA1/2_ mutation, which usually accounts for only a small proportion of cancer cases.

Given that about 20% of CRCs have defects in DDR-associated genes, **the overarching aim of the research in my lab is to shed light on the sensitivity of CRC cells to PARPi**. This is investigated by assessment of the DNA damage response, cytotoxicity and cell cycle regulation in CRC cell lines in response to treatment with Olaparib or Talazoparib.

In addition to the role of PARP in the DNA damage response, PARP activity can deplete cellular NAD+ levels to form poly(ADP-ribose) polymers (PAR). As a result, PARP activity indirectly influences the regulation of NAD+-dependent metabolic enzymes and hence, metabolic homeostasis. My lab is also interested in investigating the cellular energetics and metabolic plasticity of CRC models and its impact on the response to PARPi and development of treatment resistance.

Ultimately, these projects will pave future directions to establish biomarkers for treatment prognosis and identify avenues to develop synergistic combinatorial approaches to improve PARPi response or re-sensitize resistant CRCs and ultimately, reduce the burden of this cancer.
