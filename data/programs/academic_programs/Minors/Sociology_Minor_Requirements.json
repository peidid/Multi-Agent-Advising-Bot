    "Minor Name": "Minor in Sociology",
    "Official Requirements Reference": "Undergraduate Dietrich College Sociology Catalog",
    "Description": "The Sociology minor introduces the student to central concepts in sociological theory and methods of empirical inquiry needed to broadly understand social behavior, including its structure, history, and dynamics. Students choose among a range of methodological approaches and substantive topic areas including social psychology, work and organizations, social networks, technology and society, medical sociology, and gender and family. Exposure to these topics will help students understand and appreciate the processes by which families, groups, and organizations form and evolve over time; by which individuals affect and are affected by the society in which they live; and by which technology and institutions shape and influence society. This background in empirical tools and social theory will strengthen the student’s ability to pursue graduate studies in sociology, social history, social science, and organizational theory; to begin professional careers involving social analysis, network analysis, data analysis of teams, groups and organizations, social analysis within journalism, political institutions, the government, and online; and to enter the corporate environment with a thorough understanding of organizational activity.",
