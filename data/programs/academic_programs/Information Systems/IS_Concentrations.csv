Data Science,"Data Science is an emerging and interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge from data.  The Data Science Concentration is designed to offer an opportunity for Information Systems students to acquire data science knowledge and skills in addition to their major. 

In this concentration, students develop knowledge and skills in data analysis and visualization, database development, machine learning, and data mining. Some of these are already covered in several IS core courses. Our data science concentration offers students an advanced understanding of how to solve problems by finding new insights data of different types, formats, and sizes. The courses related to this concentration explain how data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms are key tools in this process.

After fulfilling the requirement of this concentration, students obtain competitive skills and knowledge to succeed as information Systems experts and data scientists in the constantly developing high-technology marketplace

DS concentration will enhance students' competitiveness and technical knowledge, and prepare them for their professional careers in many aspects of managing, mining, integrating, and analyzing data across a wide array of fields such as business, medicine, bioinformatics, government, education, marketing, security, financial management, and many other fields.","Data science careers span almost every sector of industry, government, and academia, and include careers in manufacturing, construction, transportation, warehousing, communication, science, health care, computer science, information technology, retail, sales, marketing, finance, insurance, education, government, security, law enforcement, and more. In fact, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, the US alone will face a shortage of more than 150,000 data analysts and an additional 1.5 million data-savvy managers.

Information Security and Privacy,"The digital age has provided society with immense affordances and efficiencies that has revolutionized how organizations and individuals function. All industries are now reliant on Information Systems for their operations and competitiveness. Data about us is kept in systems that span healthcare, banking, education, transport, retail, governmental services, and social networks – to name a few. This data is often necessary for our engagement with a world that is increasingly digitized. In such contexts, we entrust the custody of our data to organizations, who ideally utilize this data for specific purposes subject to our consent.
Nonetheless, our data in such organizations may be compromised. Proper regulations and safeguards may be inadequate, presenting opportunities for internal misuse and abuse, or external intrusion and manipulation. What technical, procedural, and regulatory safeguards are necessary to safeguard our data? What rights do we hold for our data and its privacy? Who should be held accountable when safeguards fail? What preventative, detective, and corrective measures should be put in place to mitigate risks to security and privacy in the digital age?
The Information Security and Privacy concentration exposes students to key technical, process, and regulatory dimensions related to information security and privacy. It establishes fundamental foundations for security and privacy, which are critical to all stakeholders whether individual, organizational, or governmental. The Security and Privacy concentration therefore aims to equip graduates with foundational skills in dynamic, rapidly-evolving, and essential fields for all stakeholders in the digital age.
