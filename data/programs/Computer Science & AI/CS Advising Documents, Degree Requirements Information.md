## 2 CS Requirements

The best way to check the progress of a student regarding their requirements for the major, minor, or
concentration is through Stellic.
Even if the student has not yet declared a minor or concentration, they are able to add the
requirements of the chosen program to their Stellic page, and it will automatically check which
requirements are already fulfilled with the courses taken or planned by the student so far. To add a minor
or concentration, the student or advisor can go to the student's page, and click on "+ add program" at the
top, and a search box will appear. Note that concentrations are listed as "Minor in SCS Concentration...",
even if they are not minors. Programs that are only added on Stellic but not officially declared will have
the tag "Not Declared" next to it.
Unfortunately, double counting rules for minors (and concentrations) in Stellic are almost all wrong.
We are working to inherit the audits from Pittsburgh to fix this. In the meantime, always double check in
the minor information or with the minor advisor. If you find inconsistencies between what Stellic is
computing and what the official requirement states, please contact the Associate Area Head.

### 2.1 CS Students

The official requirements for a student to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science are
detailed here: Official requirements - BS in Computer Science
The official requirements for a student to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence
are detailed here: Official requirements - BS in Artificial Intelligence
The following is an overall summary of the requirements:
● 360 units to graduate
● 99-103, Core@CMU
● 7/9 core courses
● 4 constrained CS electives
○ CS: Domains, AI, Logic & Languages, and Systems
○ AI: Decision Making & Robotics, Machine Learning, Perception & Language, Human AI
● 2 general CS electives, each at least 9-units (note: independent study or senior thesis counts)
● 6/7 Math courses + 1 Technical Communication
● General Education (aka GenEd):
○ 4 Science/Engineering
○ 63 units (roughly 7 courses) in Humanities/Arts
● Ethics course **(AI only)**
● Minor or Concentration **(CS only)**

#### 2.1.1 Science/Engineering requirement

The Science and Engineering requirements for the CS and AI majors is composed of four courses
with the following constraints:
● 9 units each at least
● Two from the same department
● At least one lab
○ If the lab course is less than 9 units (such as Chem 101), then students still need 4 other
science courses.


```
○ Astronomy with the lab component DOES NOT satisfy this requirement (33-124 and
33-126).
```
#### 2.1.2 Humanities/Arts requirement

```
The Humanities and Arts requirement includes:
● 76-101 Interpretation and Argument (typically)
● One course from various category:
○ There are three categories:
■ Cognition, Choice and Behavior: typically Organizational Behavior, Philosophy
(80-xxx), and Psychology (85-xxx) (CS only)
or
Cognitive Studies: a subset of the previous category (AI only)
■ Economic, Political and Social Institutions: typically Economics (73-xxx),
Philosophy (80-xxx), and Political Science (84-xxx).
■ Cultural Analysis: typically History (79-xxx), Philosophy (80-xxx), Modern
Languages (82-xxx).
○ Check Stellic for the most updated list of which courses count for each category. (The
catalog tends to be a subset of what is on Stellic.)
○ If a student thinks a course should count for a category but doesn’t, then ask that student
to submit their argument (usually 1-3 paragraphs) and a copy of the course syllabus to
the AAH. We will pass it along to a committee in Pittsburgh that evaluates such requests.
● Three more courses of at least 9 units.
○ 76-100 (Reading and Writing in an Academic Context) is one of these for most students.
● Note: Students may combine Humanities/Arts courses (for example, Micro Courses) with lower units together to form a single
course of 9 units or more (as per GenEd Catalog). If they are going to be used for one of the
three categories, the courses need to be in the same theme. This needs to be approved by the
Area Head or Associate Area Head.

#### Micro Courses:
as a Computer Science student, you can use micro courses and other courses with lower unit values to satisfy your Humanities and Arts requirements under specific conditions.
According to the sources, the following rules apply:
• Combining Units: You may combine multiple Humanities/Arts courses with lower units to form the equivalent of a single course of 9 units or more.
• Thematic Consistency: If these combined courses are being used to fulfill one of the three specific distribution categories—Cognition, Choice and Behavior; Economic, Political and Social Institutions; or Cultural Analysis—they must be in the same theme.
• Required Approval: Any plan to combine lower-unit courses to satisfy a requirement must be approved by the Area Head or Associate Area Head.
An example of an available micro-course is 76-253 Information Graphics, which is worth 3 units. For your overall degree, you are required to complete a minimum of 63 units in Humanities and Arts, which typically translates to roughly seven 9-unit courses. You should also be aware that deadlines for micro courses differ from regular full-semester courses.

```
#### 2.1.3 Minors

```
● Information on available minors and how to apply, including self-defined minor:
https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-services/minor-information/.
● Self-defined minors should focus on areas outside of Computer Science. If there is any
uncertainty, advisors should consult the Associate Area Head or another appropriate faculty
member before the student submits the request. (Just to avoid wasted time.)
● The student should figure out if they need to declare a minor (no hard deadline, automatically
approved) or apply to a minor (check deadline, might not be approved). They should talk to the
minor advisor.
● The process is to fill out and submit the form found at the Scotty link above.
● Once the minor is declared, you and the student will be able to see it on both S3 and Stellic (or
the "Not Declared" tag on Stellic will disappear).
```
#### 2.1.4 Concentrations

The departments in the School of Computer Science offer the following concentrations
(Undergraduate Concentrations):
● Algorithms & Complexity (Dept: CSD)
● Computational Biology (Dept: CB)
● Computer Graphics (Dept: CSD)
● Computer Systems (Dept: CSD)


● Human-Computer Interaction (Dept: HCI)
● Language Technologies (Dept: LTI)
● Machine Learning (Dept: ML)
● Principles of Programming Languages (Dept: CSD)
● Robotics (Dept: RI)
● Security and Privacy (S3D - prev. ISR)
● Software Engineering (S3D - prev. ISR)
Students at CMUQ can complete the following concentrations without taking courses in Pittsburgh:
● Algorithms & Complexity
● Computer Systems
● Programming Languages
Others are doable with a semester in Pittsburgh; this requires careful planning with your advisor.
To declare a concentration, students must email the Academic Program Manager at the Academic
Affairs Office in CMUQ (currently Jarrin Nevel – jfn@andrew.cmu.edu) to add the concentration to their
record on S3. A concentration is considered officially declared only when it is added to S3.
If a student needs to count research credits or an unlisted course towards a concentration, approval
needs to be received by the concentration director in Pittsburgh according to the following guidelines:
● Concentration directors are listed in the course catalog:
SCS Concentrations < Carnegie Mellon University
● For course substitutions (other than independent studies or research thesis), the student can
contact the Associate Area Head.
● For counting an Honor’s Thesis or Independent Study, the research advisor should contact the
concentration director.
● Once written approval for any exception is given by the concentration director, this needs to be
forwarded to the Associate Area Head so that the exception is properly added to the student's
Stellic.
Notes:
● S3 and Stellic treat concentrations as minors. Students need not worry about this technicality.
● Concentrations appear on transcripts and not on diplomas.
● In the Algo concentration:
○ The 3 exclusive courses (which should not be used towards any other minor, major, etc.)
include 15-455.
○ Some of the courses overlap with courses that students need for the Math Minor. The
Math minor does not care about concentrations. So, if a student uses Combinatorics,
Graph Theory to also satisfy the concentration, the math minor people won’t complain.

#### 2.1.5 SCS Senior Theses Awards

Students in the CMU Qatar campus that do a senior theses are eligible for the SCS senior theses
awards. There are two of them:
● SCS Newel Award
○ Awarded by the SCS Dean’s office
○ There is a prize money


○ Current committee (as of Fall 2024): Tom Cortina, Phillip Compeau, Guy Blelloch, Reid
Simmons
● SCS Alumni Association award
○ Overseen by Philip Lehman
To be eligible for the award, the Area Head should send to the Associate Dean for Undergraduate
Programs (currently Tom Cortina) the senior theses, posters, and a recording of the final presentation
(max 15 minute).
_2.1.6 Majoring and CS and AI_
If a student wants to major in both CS and AI, they can double count:
● 5 core courses: 15-122, 15-150, 15-210, 15-213, and 15-
● All math requirements (note that AI has an additional math requirement: 36-401)
● All general education courses (note that the cognition category is more restricted for AI)
● 17-200 for ethics (AI) and technical communication (CS) (but this course is not offered at CMUQ)
Note that double majors need to choose an additional AI course to be used for the AI elective for the
CS major, and need to take 4 SCS electives, since all the allowable double counts are already filled.
The additional major in AI is described here: AI Additional Major.
The additional major in CS is described here: CS Additional Major.

###### Minimum number of units required for the degree:

  
\*The flexibility in the curriculum allows many different schedules, of which the above is only one possibility. Some elective courses are offered only once per year (Fall or Spring). Constrained electives (probability, logic/languages, software systems, artificial intelligence and domains) may be taken in any order and in any semester if prerequisites are met and seats are available. Constrained electives are shown in the specific semesters in the schedule above as an example only. Students should consult with their academic advisor to determine the best elective options depending on course availability, their academic interests and their career goals.  

### Undergraduate Research Thesis

CS majors may use the SCS Honors Research Thesis as part of their degree. The SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis (07-599) typically starts in the fall semester of the senior year, and spans the entire senior year. Students receive a total of 36 units of academic credit for the thesis work, 18 units per semester. Up to 18 units can be counted toward CS elective requirements (9 per semester for 2 semesters maximum).  Students interested in research may also consider using Research and Innovation in Computer Science (07-300, 9 units) as their technical communications requirement in their junior year since this course will introduce students to various research projects going on in the School of Computer Science that may lead to a senior thesis. This course leads to a subsequent Research Practicum in Computer Science (07-400, 12 units) that allows students to complete a small-scale research study or experiment and present a research poster. Students who use 15-400 to start their senior thesis can use these units toward the required 36 units.

For more information about the SCS Honors Research Thesis, refer to the SCS Honors Research Thesis section for learning objectives, application requirements and expected outcomes.

### Dual Degree in Computer Science

Students wishing to pursue a Dual Degree in Computer Science are required to apply in the same way as students wishing to transfer into the Computer Science major. Details are given in the SCS Policies section. Besides the student's primary degree requirements, a student accepted for Dual Degree in CS is required to complete at least 450 units in total and meet all requirements for the CS major including all general education requirements (humanities/arts and science/engineering). Dual degree students do not need to complete 07-128, and these students will replace 15-151 with either 21-127 or 21-128. Since the CS major requires at least a minor or concentration in another area, the student's primary major will substitute for this requirement. Note that the primary major must be completed prior to or at the same time as the dual degree in CS to satisfy the minor requirement; a dual degree in CS cannot be certified if the primary degree is not completed. Students should consult with the Assistant Dean in the CS Undergraduate Office and/or their CS academic advisor to review all requirements, once approved.

### Required Minor or Concentration

Students completing the bachelor's degree in Computer Science must complete either a minor outside of SCS or a concentration within SCS. A minor is a sequence of (typically 5-6) courses within a particular department to give students a core of a specific discipline but not an entire major of study. Refer to the sections for other CMU colleges for details about available non-SCS minors. An SCS concentration is a sequence of (typically 4-5) courses within an SCS department to give students further depth in specific areas of research important to SCS. SCS concentrations are available only to SCS students and assume that these students have a significant core knowledge in Computer Science including 15-210, 15-213 and 15-251. See the SCS Concentrations section for a list of available concentrations and their requirements. Completion of an additional major (or dual degree) also satisfies this requirement. Students should consult with their academic advisor to plan for their desired minor or concentration starting in the sophomore year.

**Double Counting**

In general, courses taken in satisfaction of the minor or additional major may also count toward any general education category in the CS major (i.e. courses outside of the Computer Science and Mathematics requirements). Double counting toward Computer Science and Mathematics courses in the CS major is strictly limited and depends on the chosen minor (or additional major). In general, students may double count at most 5 of the 12 core Computer Science requirements toward all other declared additional majors and minors. Additional majors and minors have their own double counting rules as well. Consult with a CS undergraduate advisor and an advisor from the department of the minor (or additional major) for specific restrictions on double counting.
