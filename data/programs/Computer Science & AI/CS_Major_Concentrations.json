The concentration is designed to be flexible in covering the wide area of systems topics. Two courses from the Computer Science major’s “systems” constrained elective are required (List A below). The other courses come from a larger list of related courses (List B below). A limited amount of research credit can count toward the requirements. Typically, systems courses include three aspects: A systems course educates students about how a class of computer systems works, both at a conceptual level and in practice. This includes the study of concrete problems faced in building a particular class of systems and successful solutions to these problems. Systems courses address how properties of modern hardware (e.g., processors, net- works, storage hierarchies) influence the design and implementation of a class of soft- ware systems. This typically includes reasoning about concurrency, and understanding and measuring performance. To solidify the key systems organization principles, there is a significant project/system implementation aspect to the course, both to reinforce understanding of how these systems work, and to learn system building skills (i.e., not just programming, but also design, debugging, testing, etc.). The size of the programming tasks is course dependent, but a significant fraction of the course grade (e.g., at least 40%) is derived from project work.

        "Concentration Name":"Principles of Programming Languages",
        "Concentration Description":"Programming languages play a central role in computer science. All programs are written in a language, and it is obvious that some are better than others, at least for some purposes. The constant demand for new languages reflects the changing demands for constructing reliable and maintainable software systems. Academic research in programming language principles has led to numerous advances in language design, language implementation, and program verification intended to meet these changing expectations through the development of a rigorous theory of programming languages. Carnegie Mellon is a recognized leader in programming languages, characterized by a strong emphasis on the centrality of type theory, a consolidation of ideas in mathematical semantics, programming logics, and programming language design and implementation. The purpose of the PoPL concentration is to teach the comprehensive view of the field that has been developed here over many decades. Type theory teaches how to define a language, and how to show that it is well-defined, free of internal contradictions. It teaches the mathematical foundations for abstraction and modularity, concepts that are fundamental to building maintainable systems. It teaches how to use a rigorous language definition as the basis for building a compiler that correctly implements the definition, and provides the tools necessary to achieve it. It teaches the logical foundations of program development, how to precisely specify the intended behavior of a program, and how to use machine tools to verify that a program meets those expectations. It gives precise meaning to language concepts, relating them to one another, and distinguishing concepts that are often confused or conflated. It teaches how to specify and verify the resource usage of a program (such as its sequential and parallel time and space complexity) without resorting to a model of how it is implemented on a machine; it supports using actual code, rather than pseudo-code, for defining and analyzing algorithms. The PoPL concentration is of value to a broad range of students. For the practically minded it will provide the foundation for structuring and validating programs, using type systems or more advanced forms of specification. For the theoretically minded it will provide the foundation for understanding the close relationship between specification and programs on one hand and mathematical conjecture and proof on the other. The elegance of the PoPL lies in their unification of these two perspectives: the theory applies directly to the practice, and the practice informs the theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVES The PoPL concentration is characterized by a collection of learning outcomes that it seeks to achieve. These may be summarized by the knowledge that students may expect to gain by concentrating in the area. By their choice of electives each student will choose an emphasis within the area; the required courses ensure that this includes at least the first five objectives: Specify the concrete and abstract syntax of a programming language, including a precise specification of the binding and scope of declarations. Define the static semantics (compile-time constraints) of a programming language using typing judgments, and how to state and prove that it properly defined. Define the dynamics semantics (run-time behavior) of a language using operational and denotational methods. Verify rigorously that the statics and dynamics of a language are coherent, a property commonly called type safety. Understand the propositions-as-types principle, which relates programs to proofs and specifications to theorems, and know how to apply it in language design and program verification. Formulate type and assertion languages for specifying the behavior of a program, and how to verify that a program satisfies such a specification. Specify the cost (sequential and parallel time and space complexity) for a program written in a precisely defined language, and how to verify that a given program meets stated cost bounds. Use software tools to verify both the properties of languages and the specifications of programs written in well-defined languages. Use the static and dynamic semantics of a language to derive a compiler for it that complies with these definitions, and how to use types and verification tools to ensure compiler correctness. Relate a language definition to its implementation, both in terms of the run-time structures required, but also to validate abstract cost measures in an implementation.",

        "Concentration Name":"Software Engineering",
        "Concentration Description":"Effectively building modern software systems at scale requires not just programming skills, but also engineering skills. These skills include the ability to interact effectively with customers to gather the requirements for a system in a precise way; to develop a design that resolves competing quality attributes; to make tradeoffs among schedule, cost, features, and quality to maximize value to stakeholders; to work effectively with other engineers; and to assure the quality of the delivered software system. We hear regularly from industry that these skills are crucial to them, and that they are interested in students with a strong software engineering background. LEARNING OBJECTIVES The software engineering concentration is designed to teach the fundamental tools, techniques, and processes of software engineering. Through internships and a mentored project experience, students gain an understanding of the issues of scale and complexity that motivate software engineering tools and techniques. The core curriculum includes material both on engineering the software product and on the process, teamwork, and management skills that are essential to successful engineering. Graduates of the program should have the technical, process, and teamwork skills to be immediately productive in a mature engineering organization.",
