## 1 Advisor Role and Resources

Every student at CMUQ has an academic advisor to help them ensure they are making progress
towards fulfilling their major requirements. The official advisor is typically a faculty in their home
department, and is listed in the students' S3 and Stellic. In the Computer Science department, there is
one advisor for first year students, and one advisor for each class that advises them from sophomore year
until graduation. The academic advisor is part of the overall students' support system at CMUQ, and the
list below summarizes the expected responsibilities of advisors. This is not an exhaustive list.
● Help with planning courses to ensure progress towards graduation.
● Adding exceptions for courses in Stellic once they are approved by the appropriate department or
faculty (e.g. counting senior theses for concentrations, placement exams for calculus courses,
graduate versions of courses).
● Help students make decisions about keeping or dropping courses.
● Ensure students remain full time and inform them of the consequences of becoming part time.
● Sign-off on applications for Pittsburgh exchange, indicating that the student has received advice
about their choice of courses.
● Check-in on students with low mid-semester grades, and help with recovery plans.
● If a student is on probation, make sure they are meeting the requirements in their probation letter.
● Be a point of contact for other instructors regarding concerns about the student in their courses.
● Evaluating and approving units overload (see Section Overloading).
● Evaluating and approving course drop, withdrawal, and pass/fail (see Section Dropping,
Withdrawing, pass/failing a course)
● Enable the use of vouchers to drop or pass/fail courses (see Section Vouchers).
● Inform the Associate Area Head and Area Head of any scheduling conflicts, waitlisted courses, or
unavailable courses that would prevent the student from graduating on time.
● Validade that all requirements are being fulfilled for the student to graduate in their senior year.
● Advise on academic actions at the end of each semester.
Additionally, academic advisors
try to be mindful of other struggles
students may be facing, and so may
act as a bridge to other resources on
campus. Each section below
describes other departments and
resources on campus that advisors
can choose to refer their students to.
It is important to note that there may
be intersections in the kind of help
that students get from each
department and the academic advisor.
At the moment, there are no reporting
rules for advisors to know whether the
student has actually reached out to
other resources or not, but they are
free to follow up with each department
and the student about it.
The following figure is a summary
of the available resources and their
roles.


### 1.1 Academic Resource Center (ARC)

The Academic Resource Center organizes workshops and provides assistance in courses by hiring
course assistants or through their own tutors. Students could be referred to ARC for:
● Workshops on practical skills; e.g., these are some workshops ARC has offered in the past:
○ Note taking: Getting more from lectures by taking better notes
○ Time management: Mapping your semester for balance & success
○ QPA forecaster
○ How to improve your performance by examining returned tests
○ Planning effective study sessions
○ Get organized with google calendar
● Help with entry level Math and Programming courses.
● Finding CA jobs.
Main Contact: ARC Director, currently Mariamma Thomas (mariamma@qatar.cmu.edu).

### 1.2 Student Affairs

Student Affairs addresses all non-academic aspects of student life at CMUQ. Students could be
referred to Student Affairs in the following situations:
● Paperwork for residency, visa, and travel.
● Housing for international students.
● Exceptional financial support.
● Activities, events, clubs.
● Community standards violations.

### 1.3 Support for Student Success

Students struggling to keep up with course work, or those that require closer attention due to other
challenges they are facing, can be directed to Damian Dourado (ddourado@qatar.cmu.edu). These are
some examples of how he can help the students to get back on track:
● hold regular meetings;
● keep closer track of progress in course work;
● set up checkpoints and reasonable goals;
● inform students of university processes (forms for different purposes, causes and consequences
of probation or suspension, possible options for failing courses, among others).
Please understand that the advisor remains as the main point of contact for academic guidance. If
you think a student needs extra support due to other challenging circumstances, you may suggest this to
the student, and contact Damian. When contacting Damian, please cc the Associate Area Head. Here is a
sample email message that can be sent to the student with Damian and AAH in CC (feel free to change
as you wish):
_Dear X,
My role as your academic advisor is to ensure that you are making progress in the Computer Science
major. I have noticed that you have been struggling to keep up with the course work which has been
negatively impacting your performance and hence your progress.
I believe that you would highly benefit from a more personalized help with your academic work.
Hence, I am referring you to Damian Dourado (cc'd in this message), CMUQ's Director of Student
Academic Success, who can coach you on how to be more effective with the load. Damian will contact
you for an initial meeting so that he can learn more about you and explain how he can help._

### 1.4 Associate Area Head and Area Head

For truly exceptional cases, for example, when students will delay graduation, if they have
disappeared or become unresponsive, or if they are underperforming consistently despite being made
aware of the available support, the associate area head and area head can be contacted. Upon being
informed of the student's situation, they can brainstorm solutions and propose exceptions if they are
warranted. They can also contact the student to be yet another person voicing concerns and nudging the
student in the right direction. If needed, they can also involve the Associate Dean for Education, currently
Dudley Reynolds (dreynolds@cmu.edu).
