The B.S. program in Computer Science combines a solid core of Computer Science courses with the ability to gain additional depth through a required minor in a second subject or a concentration in a computing area. In addition, the curriculum provides breadth through numerous choices for science, engineering, humanities and fine arts courses. As computing is a discipline with strong links to many fields, this provides students with unparalleled flexibility to pursue allied (or non-allied) interests. 

Students apply to, and are directly admitted into, the School of Computer Science. Admitted students may choose to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and, upon successful completion, are awarded a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Suitably prepared students from other Carnegie Mellon colleges are eligible to apply for internal transfer to the School of Computer Science and will be considered for transfer if grades in core CS requirements are sufficiently high and space is available.

Students in the B.S. program in Computer Science are expected to acquire the following skills upon graduation:

-   Identify, use, design, develop and analyze appropriate abstractions and algorithms to solve problems while being able to prove the algorithm’s performance and correctness across a variety of metrics (e.g., time, space, parallel vs. sequential implementation, computability).
-   Implement solutions to problems in domains such as artificial intelligence, graphics and sound, software engineering, and human-computer interaction, by applying the fundamentals of those areas to create solutions to current problems while being exposed to research developments that will enable them to adapt as the technology changes.
-   Reason about and implement programs in various programming languages and paradigms
-   Describe, specify, and develop large-scale, open-ended software systems subject to constraints such as performance and/or resource issues
-   Communicate technical material effectively to technical and non-technical audiences
-   Work both individually and in teams
-   Recognize the social impact of computing and the attendant responsibility to consider the legal, moral and ethical implications of computing technologies.

Due to the tremendous number of ongoing research projects within the School, many students obtain part-time or summer jobs, or receive independent study credit, working on research while pursuing their undergraduate degree. Students seeking a research/graduate school career may pursue an intensive course of research, equivalent to four classroom courses, culminating in the preparation of a senior research thesis.

The School of Computer Science also offers B.S. degrees in Artificial Intelligence, Computational Biology, Human-Computer Interaction, and Robotics, as well as a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and the Arts (jointly with the College of Fine Arts). More detail about the Artificial Intelligence, Computational Biology, Human-Computer Interaction, and Robotics majors as well as the Computer Science and the Arts program is available in separate sections of the Undergraduate Catalog. SCS offers additional majors in Artificial Intelligence, Computational Biology, Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Robotics, and minors (to non-CS majors) in Artificial Intelligence, Computational Biology, Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Language Technologies, Machine Learning, Neural Computation, Robotics, and Software Engineering. Information about additional majors and minors in SCS besides those in Computer Science are listed in a separate section in the Undergraduate Catalog.
