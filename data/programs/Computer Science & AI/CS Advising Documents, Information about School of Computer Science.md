### 4.2 Degrees

#### 4.2.1 Undergraduate Programs

In Pittsburgh, students are admitted to SCS; then declare their chosen bachelor's degree. The offered
B.S. degrees are:
● Computer Science (Managed by CS, ISR)
● Computational Biology (Managed by CB)
● Artificial Intelligence (Managed by RI, MLD, & LTI)
● Statistics and Machine Learning (MLD & Stats)
● Human-Computer Interaction
In addition to the above, the following programs are offered:
● Additional Major (CS, HCI, Robotics)
● Minors (CS, Neural Comp, HCI, SW Eng, CB, LTI, ML, Rob)
● Concentrations (Systems, Security, Theory, SW Eng, CB)


#### 4.2.2 Fifth Year Scholar Program

```
● Fifth year free of cost program at CMU to explore new fields of study:

```
#### 4.2.3 Fifth Year Master's

```
● Research based Masters in Pittsburgh for CMU CS students only.
● Can start in Summer, Fall, or Spring.
● Application deadline for the fall cycle is in October.
● Decisions announced in November.
● Application deadline for the spring cycle in January.
● Decisions will be announced in February.
● More information at: Master's Programs Admissions | Carnegie Mellon University - Computer
Science Department
● Not free, actually very expensive. Tuition fees is same as regular masters program with the
summer semester thrown in as a freebie
● The requirement of having an advisor by the application deadline is waived for CMUQ students.
```
#### 4.2.4 Other Master's Programs

```
● CSD (CS, Computational Data Science with LTI)
● CBD (CB, Biotech Innovation and Comp with LTI)
● RI (Rob, Vision, Rob Sys Dev, Rob Tech)
