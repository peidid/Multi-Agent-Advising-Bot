## 3 Essential Information

### 3.1 Definitions

```
● Pass/Fail: A student can change a course to Pass/Fail before the pass/fail deadline for the
semester.
● Passed units: Total units counting towards 360 unit graduation requirement.
● Factorable units: units counted towards QPA calculations.
● Full-Time student: A student is considered full-time if taking 36 units or more. This number
includes units in mini-courses.

### 3.3 Managing Courses

#### 3.3.1 Dropping, Withdrawing, Pass/Failing

A drop equals the course and its load "vanishing". Any other option, where a letter grade is assigned
(A to R, X, P, N, I), is counted in the "load". Now, for those counted in the load, only A to R, and X are
factorable, which means they have quality weights that enter the QPA calculation. The other grades are
not factorable and do not impact the QPA (but count towards the load).
**Dropping**
A dropped course disappears from the student's transcript. If a student wants to drop a course, here
are some things for you to consider:
● Will the student become part-time? (Students can be part time with an exception from the
Associate Dean for Education. If they go part time without such an exception, they will go on
probation.) Approval is not common.
● How does the course affect student progress towards the major? Can the student drop a different
course that has fewer effects?
● Dropping a course because the student will not be getting an A (or B... or C) requires a reality
check with the student. Try to discourage them from "QPA Sculpting", especially when it will
impact their future semesters.
● Dropping and Withdrawing before the deadlines can be done by the student themselves on S3.
(Unless they are a freshman, then ask them to email Jarrin and copy their advisor.)


```
● Dropping a course with a pending or reported academic integrity violation is prohibited. (New
rules effective 26 Aug 2024.)
Withdrawing
● After the drop deadline, the student can still withdraw from the course by the 10th week of
classes (check calendar). Withdrawing after that deadline is not allowed (even with a voucher).
● Withdrawn courses are still in the transcript, with grade W.
● Withdrawn courses still count towards a student’s total number of units for the semester.
○ This means, for example, that withdrawing does not impact a student’s full-time/part-time
status.
○ Not everyone in various admin roles at CMU may realize this, so contact the AH or AAH if
you run into an issue.
○ It is important to note that some financial aid providers have their own rules, so if a
student is withdrawing from a course and not counting that course would put them below
36 units, they should talk to Sheila to make sure their funder isn’t going to get mad.
● Withdrawing from a course with a pending or reported academic integrity violation may be
possible with a series of approvals. (New rules effective 26 Aug 2024.) To do that, please consult
with Dina Al-Abdi (Office of Community Responsibility Academic Integrity Liaison).
Pass/failing
● P/N courses will count towards the total number of units.
● P/N courses will not count for any major or minor requirements.
```
#### 3.3.2 Vouchers

Each undergraduate student receives three vouchers for their time at CMU. The voucher allows a
student to drop or P/NP a course up until the last day of classes. The student can use only one voucher in
any semester.
The deadline for using a voucher is set and enforced by the registrar in Pittsburgh and is not flexible.
You can’t “back date” the request after the deadline like you can with some forms.
Instructions:
● A student wishing to drop a course after the deadline must first consult with their academic
advisor. It is important to note that vouchers are not intended to be used for exceptional or
extenuating circumstances.
● After consultation, the academic advisor will initiate a drop voucher request in S3.
○ S3→ Student Page → Academic Records→ Registration: Student Registration→ Click on
the wheel by the course name.
● After the request is initiated by the advisor, the student will receive an automated email
requesting that they confirm the voucher information is correct within SIO (by selecting 'Official
Schedule' under the 'Registration' tab, and clicking 'Confirm Drop'). The student will have 24
hours to confirm the drop; otherwise, the course will remain on their record.
Please note that students who face family, health or other personal crises will be considered on
an individual basis as they are today and will not be required to use a voucher for such emergencies.

#### 3.3.3 Passing with a C vs D

```
● Students need a C or better for all core courses that are not terminal.
```

```
● C or better is required in some Constrained or General Electives (must check catalog) – for
example some concentrations require a grade of C or better for a course to count towards the
concentration.
● If a student receives a passing grade (D or better) and takes the course again, both grades show
up, S3 double counts the units, but we don’t.
```
#### 3.3.4 Course repeats

```
● Only one set of units of a course counts for graduation requirements.
● Some repeats may count as separate courses (e.g. independent studies and thesis).
```
#### 3.3.5 Waitlists

```
● Cleared in the beginning of the semester by associate area head.
● Students are placed on waitlists to give priority to other students (in major, for example).
● You, the advisor, can see the waitlist and roster for any class in S3. This can help you give your
students an idea of where they sit and their chances of getting in. You can also email the AAH for
a given program and just ask them their opinion on the waitlist for a given course.
● If a student needs an overload or has a schedule conflict, they cannot be automatically added to
a course they were waitlisted for. In this case, if they are allowed in the course, they will receive
an email with an invitation to solve the conflict and register. Note that there will be a deadline for
registering.
```
#### 3.3.6 Overloading

Here are the full load and overload limit for CS students:
● For _fall_ and _spring_ semester: full load is 54 units; overload limit is 63.
● For _summer_ semesters: full load is 24 units; there is no explicit overload limit specified in policies,
and summer overloading probably shouldn’t happen. In the rare case where it could make sense,
overloading for one additional course could be considered. We should discourage it, however,
since summer courses are so fast paced. (To estimate workload, multiple summer load by 2.5 to
compare to a normal semester. For example, taking 27 units in the summer is similar to taking 67
units during a normal semester.)
Students can overload up to the overload limit with their advisor’s approval. They can go higher with the
Associate Dean of Education's approval.
The CMUQ requirements for overloading are:
● at least 45 factorable units in previous semester and
● previous semester QPA above 3.0 or previous semester cumulative QPA above 3.0.
Advisor approval should be done based on this policy. In general, if the student meets the above
requirements then you should approve the overload. If the student doesn’t meet the requirements, then
you should not approve it and the student would need to directly appeal to the Associate Dean of
Education.
Overloads can be set directly on S3 _after registration week_. Go to the student's profile on S3, then, in
the tab "Academic Records", click on "Student Registration" in the left menu. There is a field called "Max
Units" that you should be able to edit. You will need to provide a justification for the overload.


### 3.4 Special Courses

#### 3.4.1 Independent Studies

```
● Students can take independent studies with CS faculty for topics that are not covered in an SCS
course.
● An independent study can be any number of units. Need to be 9+ units to count as a CS free
elective.
● Independent studies can be research or project based.
● If a student wants to do an independent study with a professor from another department, this
needs to be loosely co-advised by someone in CS to ensure there is enough technical content to
qualify for a CS independent study.
```
#### 3.4.2 StuCo Courses

```
● Up to 9 credits counts towards 360 units.
```
#### 3.4.3 Cross Registration

● See: https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-services/cross-registration/
● Cross-registration is open to full-time students at the sophomore level and higher.
● Full-time students may cross-register for one course per semester.
● When cross-registered, students must adhere to the host school’s academic calendar (start date,
drop/withdrawal deadlines, final exam, etc.).
● The final grade that the host school reports will appear on the home transcript.
● The final grade will factor into the student’s QPA.
If a student wants to use a cross-registered course for one of their requirements, they need to provide
the syllabus of the course and get authorization from the Area Head, who works with Pittsburgh to make
sure the course fulfills the expectation of the category.
Sep 2024 Note: Right now, cross registration is a mess. Students frequently don’t get approved for
the cross-reg courses they want because the other campus says it is full. Sheila now sends out a list of
courses each semester that other EC schools have promised to have some space in, so encourage
students to work off this list.

### 3.5 Probation, Suspension, or Expulsion

● Causes: lack of progress towards the degree, QPA, Academic Integrity, fall below full-time, or
other severe violations.
○ QPA-related:
■ Semester QPA is below 2.
■ Cumulative QPA is below 2.
○ Progress related guidelines (this is not an automatic probation, depends on case):
■ Has not finished all core 100 level courses by the end of sophomore year;
■ Has not finished all core 200 level courses by the end of junior year;
■ Has attempted core courses twice and not passed (if a student drops a course in
the beginning of the semester, it is not a real attempt).
● Suspensions:
○ A student goes on suspension if they are already on probation, and at the end of the
probation semester, they should go on probation again.
○ Exception: If a student goes on probation for a low QPA, and then the next semester their
semester QPA is above 2.0 but their cumulative is still below 2.0, they aren’t suspended.
Instead they just continue on probation.


### 3.6 Changing Major

```
● See: https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/cmuq-policy-on-changing-majors/
● Ask students to coordinate with the associate area head of the destination major.
● Official applications are processed at the end of year only, but in practice students can start
working towards the destination major prior to transfer (as long as the destination major agrees).
● Students cannot be on probation to officially transfer.
● Until an official transfer is in place, the home major advisor is still the primary advisor. The advisor
is responsible for:
○ verifying that the student is in touch with the destination major AAH (e.g. confirmation
email from AAH);
○ informing the student that, until the transfer takes place, they are still in the original major
and should be aware of any delay expected if they choose to continue with the original
major, or are not admitted to the destination major.
```
### 3.7 Alternative Majors

If a student cannot finish their original major, but they have enough credits and courses in other
topics, they might benefit from graduating in a student-defined major or bachelor's in general studies. For
more information about those options, check the links below.
● Bachelor's in General Studies: Interdisciplinary Programs < Carnegie Mellon University
● Student Defined Major: Undergraduate Options < Carnegie Mellon University

### 3.8 Campus exchange

```
● Qatar students are allowed, but not guaranteed, one semester in Pittsburgh.
● Qatar students are allowed any number of summers in Pittsburgh.
● Exchange happens through an application process that starts around the middle of the semester
before the exchange semester.
● There is no fixed criteria but in general:
○ Students are in good academic standing.
○ Students have an application that is thoughtful.
○ Normally we only allow Juniors and Seniors.
○ Space limits from Pittsburgh.
● When going to Pittsburgh, advisors should recommend courses that are not offered in Qatar.
● While in Pittsburgh, Mark Stehlik has offered to serve as an advisor to the students. If you need
help with one of your students, feel free to reach out to Mark as someone who is on the ground
(and in the timezone). For extreme situations, reach out to Tom Cortina.
```
### 3.9 First-Year Advising

```
This is a place where we collect all sorts of considerations when advising first-year students.
● The first year advisor typically has a meeting with the instructors teaching freshmen (15-112,
21-127, and Immigration) to have a better idea of who can make it and who is in trouble each
time grades are released.
● If a student is failing 15-112, we do not advise them to drop mid-way. Instead, we let them follow
the course until the end, so that they are better prepared for the content and load when they
retake it.
○ If the student is still failing during the last week of the semester, and the 15-112 instructor
agrees that the student will not pass, then a voucher should be considered for the drop.
```

○ Keep in mind that a D in 15-112 is passing for Information System students (who don’t
need 15-122), so if a student is getting a D they might not want to voucher it in case they
change majors later.
● The Fall mid-semester grades are not very informative for students who are not taking concepts,
and will only begin pre-concepts in the second half of the semester. Keep this in mind when
evaluating their first mids-semester grades.
● If a student fails 15-112 in the Fall, they can still graduate on time. Here is a tentative plan:
○ 1S: 15-112 and concepts (21-127)
2F: 15-150* and a CS elective
2S: 15-122 and 15-251*
3F: 15-213* and a CS Elective
3S: 15-210 and a CS Elective
4F: 15-451 and a CS Elective
4S: Two CS Electives
