## ****Tala Sadaqa****

Hello, BioSci Class of 2029! I am Tala Sadaqa, and you’ll probably see me wearing many hats this semester, from peer mentor to BioSci Club and DOCS-Q executive member to Honors Modern Bio CA, but above all, I hope you can see me as a friend and resource throughout your studies. I dabble in CS and computational biology, and I have spent this summer doing research in a fruit fly lab at CMU-Pittsburgh, so if you have any questions about these things, I am always happy to chat!
