## **SURA Projects 2025**

#### _**Project-1**_

#### **_Integrin beta1-C2 subcloning_**

The beta1A and beta1C2 integrin isoforms were shown to have cell line-specific expression patterns in two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 (non-invasive) and MDAMB231 (invasive). In order to understand whether the different cell behaviors are controlled by distinct integrin isoforms, the project aims to create the beta1C2 expression plasmid using the site-directed mutagenesis technique. You will generate and clone the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin beta1C2 from the beta1A cDNA to make a mammalian expression vector. The learned techniques involve Site-directed mutagenesis PCR, transformation, selection, DNA extraction, and DNA sequencing analysis. The validated plasmid will be used to express beta1C2 in MDAMB231 cells.

#### **_Disease-causing mutants of Piezo1_**

You will use site-directed mutagenesis to create mutants of the mechanosensory protein Piezo1, using a plasmid encoding WT Piezo1 as the template. These mutations are relevant to human disease.

#### _**Project-**_**_3_**

#### **_Knockout of alternatively spliced exon using CRISPR/Cas9_**

Students will clone a plasmid that expresses a guide RNA that targets exon2 of the gene hnRNPA2B1, exon 7 of ExoC7 or exon 4 of TMEM63B to knock it out in breast cancer cells

#### _**Project-**_**_4_**

#### **_Analysis of the effect of knock down of cancer specific genes on gene expression_**

Students will perform RT-PCR for various genes after knock down of PARP1, MAPK14, or A2B1 in breast cancer cells.

#### _**Project-**_**_5_**

#### **_Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Phosphate Ion Removal_**

Students will prepare iron and iron-molybdenum oxides and investigate their efficiency in removing phosphate ions, as pollutants, from water

#### _**Project-**_**_6_**

#### **_Effect of PARP inhibition on the expression of genes involved in treatment resistance in colorectal cancer cells_**

Poly-ADP Ribose Polymerase (PARP) inhibition is used as an anti-cancer treatment and leverages on exacerbating defects in the DNA damage response pathway in cancer cells. Colorectal cancers (CRC) are resistant to treatment with PARP inhibitors. The student will assess the effect of PARP inhibition on the expression of genes involved in treatment resistance in CRC cell lines.  
Skillset developed: Primer generation/optimization, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, quantitative RT-PCR, literature review, data analysis and presentation

#### _**Project-**_**_7_**

#### **_Exploring Potential Mechanisms Mediating the Effects of Silver Nanoparticles on Cancer Cells_**

This project is a collaboration between Prof Nesrine Affara and Prof Nimer Murshid. Silver nanoparticles of a specific shape and size have been previously used to treat colon tumor cells with increasing doses. Fibroblasts cells were used as normal counterpart cells. Students will prepare cell lysates of nanoparticle-treated tumor cells and run western blots to analyze the effect of nanoparticles on downstream signaling markers, including p-Akt, Akt, cleaved caspase 3, p53, and cyclin D1 and compare those levels to beta-actin. Students will learn how to prepare cell lysates and gels for western blots, optimize antibody conditions, and quantitate the bands.

#### _**Project-**_**_8_**

#### **_Assessing the effects of lycopene and beta-carotene, alone and in combination on tumocells versus fibroblasts_**

Students will prepare cell lysates derived from breast tumor cells (MCF-7 and T47D cells) that have been treated with the two antioxidants, lycopene and beta carotene, either alone or in combination. Normal stromal cells (Fibroblasts) will be used as control cells. Students will run western blots to analyze downstream signaling markers, including p-Akt, Akt, cleaved caspase 3, p53, bax, bcl2 and compare those levels to beta-actin. Students will also assess whether this treatment will affect the progression of the fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). To assess this, students will run western blots to evaluate levels of CAF markers such as FAP, vimentin, p-vimentin, and PDGFR-alpha. Skills acquired throughout the SURA project will include learning how to prepare cell lysates and gels for western blots, optimize antibody conditions, and quantitate the bands.

#### **_The Matrix: ECM-specific regulation of select genes expression in MDAMB231 breast cancer cells_**

We recently have shown that breast cancer cell adhesion to different extracellular proteins changes its gene expression in a matrix-specific manner.  
Several genes of interest will be validated through qPCR and PCR techniques. The student will generate primers for target genes and study the expression of 3 to 4 genes of interest using the abovementioned techniques.

#### _**Project-**_**_10_**

#### **_Solubility profiling of flavones for eutectic solvents_**

Our lab is currently working on using an optimised eutectic mixture as a drug delivery system. Students will measure the solubility of a number of natural and synthetic flavones to establish whether solubility is enhanced when such flavones are dissolved in eutectic solvents (wrt to water) and how much water can be added before the solubility enhancement is lost.
