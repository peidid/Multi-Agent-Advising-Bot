    "Description": "Provides non-business majors with foundational knowledge in business functions, including Global Business, Accounting, Economics, Business Technology, and Business Statistics. Each course is 9 units. Students must complete all six required courses (54 units total). At least one of the constrained courses has to be taken for the minor to be completed. Completion of any additional constrained courses will become an elective.",
    "Notes": "Students with a primary major in Information Systems using the Business Administration minor to complete the Information Systems concentration have restricted course options by the Information Systems major and should consult with their primary major advisor. Next, BS in Mathematical Sciences with Operations Research and Statistics (MSORSTA) majors must complete 27 units of business electives since their major already requires 70-122 and 73-102. Business electives cannot double-count with any other major or minor requirements."
