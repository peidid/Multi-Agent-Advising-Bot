    "Minor Name": "Minor in Mathematical Sciences",
    "Official Requirements Reference": "Undergraduate Mellon College of Science",
    "Description": "The Minor in Mathematical Sciences, administered by the Undergraduate Mellon College of Science, provides a rigorous foundation in mathematical reasoning, proof techniques, and advanced topics. Beginning with an introductory course in mathematical concepts and proofs, students then deepen their understanding through discrete mathematics or theoretical computer science. Core coursework includes linear algebra and real analysis, ensuring proficiency in both computational methods and rigorous analysis. Two 300-level (or higher) electives allow exploration of specialized areas such as abstract algebra, topology, probability, or applications in computational finance. Electives counted toward this minor may not also satisfy requirements for any other major or minor, preserving the integrity of each program. This minor equips students with the quantitative and abstract problem-solving skills valued in research, data science, finance, and technology careers. Computational Finance majors should consult a separate document for the tailored version of this minor.",
    "Required Courses": "(21-127    Concepts of Mathematics or 21-128    Mathematical Concepts and Proofs or 15-151    Mathematical Foundations for Computer Science) and (21-228    Discrete Mathematics or 15-251    Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science) and (21-241    Matrices and Linear Transformations or 21-242    Matrix Theory) and (21-355    Principles of Real Analysis I or 21-455    Intermediate Real Analysis I) and 21-xxx Mathematical Sciences Elective (300-level or higher) and 21-xxx Mathematical Sciences Elective (300-level or higher)",
    "Transfer Credit": "To avoid excessive double-counting, the two mathematical sciences electives may not also count toward any other major or minor requirement.",
    "Notes": "Computational Finance majors should refer to the other document for this minor."
