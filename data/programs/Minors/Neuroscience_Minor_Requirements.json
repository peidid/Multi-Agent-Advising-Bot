    "Minor Name": "Minor in Neuroscience",
    "Official Requirements Reference": "Undergraduate Department of Biological Sciences",
    "Description": "The curriculum within the Neuroscience minor will allow students from various disciplines to gain fundamental knowledge of neuroscience concepts. The interdisciplinary nature of the coursework echoes the nature of the field itself; students will select courses from the natural, social, and computer sciences. Neuroscientists not only require foundational knowledge of molecular, cellular, and systems neuroscience, but they should also understand the behavioral significance and appreciate how computational work and imaging techniques can aid in clarifying normal and abnormal functioning of these fundamental processes. Students pursuing the minor in Neuroscience will: Acquire foundational knowledge of the basic biological foundations of the nervous system, from the cellular through systems levels. Understand the effects of basic neurological function on behavior, including cognition. Gain an appreciation of the interdisciplinary nature of the field of neuroscience. All university students are eligible to pursue a minor in neuroscience in conjunction with a major in any other department in the university. A minimum of seven courses must be completed to fulfill the minor in neuroscience. The curriculum includes four required courses and three elective courses as specified below. Units awarded for undergraduate research are not applicable to elective courses. Courses taken in other departments or colleges will be considered on an individual basis by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.",
    "Required Courses": "(03-121    Modern Biology or 03-151    Honors Modern Biology) and 03-362    Cellular Neuroscience and  03-363    Systems Neuroscience and (85-219    Foundations of Brain and Behavior or 03-161    Molecules to Mind)",
    "Neurobiology Elective Requirements": "03-133    Neurobiology of Disease and/or 03-351    Computation and Biology Integrated Research Lab and/or 03-360/02-319    Genomics and Epigenetics of the Brain and/or 03-365    Neural Correlates of Learning and Memory and/or 03-366    Neuropharmacology: Drugs, Brain and Behavior and/or 85-104    Psychopathology and/or  85-211    Cognitive Psychology and/or 85-310    Research Methods in Cognitive Psychology and/or 85-370    Perception and/or 85-406    Autism: Psychological and Neuroscience Perspectives and/or 85-414    Cognitive Neuropsychology and/or 85-435    Biologically Intelligent Exploration and/or 03-119    Biology for Life Special Topics Micro *Offered only in Doha, requires approval from minor advisor.",
    "Transfer Credit": "Because the curriculum within this minor may overlap with some degree requirements, no more than 2 courses fulfilling Neuroscience Minor requirements may count towards the requirements of a student’s major or other minor. ",
    "Notes": "There are 4 required courses as per the list. Neurobiology requires 27 units taken with at least 1 course in the 300-level or higher. 85-213 may be used instead of 85-211 when offered. 03-119 is Offered only in Doha, requires approval from minor advisor. "
