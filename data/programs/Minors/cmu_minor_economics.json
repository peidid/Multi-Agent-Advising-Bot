    "campus": "Qatar",
    "Description": "Provides non‐economics majors with foundational training in economic theory and quantitative analysis through 9-unit economics courses.",
    "Notes": "Courses used to fulfill the minor cannot double-count with any other major or minor. Students who have taken coursework in intermediate-level regression analysis and data visualization may petition to substitute 73-274 Econometrics I or 73-423 Forecasting for Economics and Business for 73-265 Economics and Data Science. Students are eligible to apply for a minor upon completion of two required courses for the minor wherein they earn a 2.0 QPA or higher in said coursework. While there are no double counting restrictions between the minor and the student's home college general education requirements, 73-265 Economics and Data Science and the 3 economics electives must be unique for the minor and cannot double count with any other major or minor."
