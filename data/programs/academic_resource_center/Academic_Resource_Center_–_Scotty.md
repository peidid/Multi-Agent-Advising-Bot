_The mission of the Academic Resource Center (ARC) is to provide comprehensive resources that help all Tartans in achieving the skills, strategies, and behaviors needed to develop as active, confident, and independent learners._

_The ARC offers a wide variety of free services, including tutoring, study skills workshops, and supplemental instruction sessions for a number of courses._

#### [Supplemental Instruction](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/supplemental-instruction/)

SI sessions are facilitated by SI leaders (undergraduate students who have previously taken and been successful in the course). If you attend SI, you’ll experience active and collaborative learning methods that will help you achieve course learning objectives.

#### [Student Employment Program](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-resource-center/undergraduate-student-employment/)

The Academic Resource Center is one of the largest employers on campus and oversees on-campus employment opportunities for undergraduates.

Whether you’re looking for more effective study strategies and approaches to learning, or you’re trying to find a way to learn the material in a discipline you haven’t experienced before, we’ve got you covered. Take a look at some resources that can help you self-assess and reflect on what you’re doing and what new strategies you might try.

#### [Academic Tutoring & Course Assistants](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/hours-location/)

Tutoring on a ‘walk-in’ basis is available at the Center. Our Course Assistants are available in highly-requested, core-curriculum courses and in a number of other subjects.

Course Assistants (CAs) are undergraduate students who are hired by faculty to assist in various courses. Course Assistants have been trained in how to tutor others and have already successfully taken the class they support. Most CAs hold a regular schedule of office hours during the week, so be sure to check your course website or ask their professors if there is a CA for their class and when they’re available.

#### [ARC Workshops](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/arc-workshops/)

The ARC offers a series of Study Skill Workshops every semester on a variety of topics ranging from creating a study schedule to avoiding procrastination from taking lecture notes. We encourage students to attend as many workshops as needed and then to visit with our staff for feedback and reflection on their study skills development.
