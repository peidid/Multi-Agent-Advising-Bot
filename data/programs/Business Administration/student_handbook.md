## Introduction

### University Policies and Expectations

It is the responsibility of each Carnegie Mellon community member to be familiar with policies and guidelines
pertaining to their role on campus. There are additional University policies for students to be aware of and
responsible to follow as Carnegie Mellon students. Sections of this handbook have been reproduced from _The
Word: Student Handbook_ and the _Undergraduate Catalog_ as the original sources. All questions regarding this
publication or University policies should be directed to the Undergraduate Programs Office.

### Carnegie Mellon Code

Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the
achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical, and moral conduct
possible. These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as
truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self.
Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.

As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the
community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an
academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above
standards do not apply.

The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these
standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot
be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be
observed, an academic community cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these
standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not
destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should
voluntarily withdraw from the University.

### Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance

Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or administration of its programs
or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender
identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon
University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws or
executive orders.


Inquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be directed to the university
ombudsman, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, telephone 412-268-

### Health and Wellness

It is essential that you take care of yourself as a CMU student. Everyone benefits from support during times of
struggle. You are not alone at CMU. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important
part of the college experience is asking for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is important. To
achieve your goals and manage stress, do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking time to relax.

If you, or anyone you know, experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, you are strongly encouraged to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is
available and ready to support all students. Consider reaching out to staff, faculty, or family members you trust
for help getting the support that can help.

### Tepper School Community Expectations

The Tepper School of Business is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive community based on trust,
respect, and support toward all individuals, intellectual endeavors, and activities. It is expected that every
individual contributes each day to recognizing, maintaining, and improving the community environment of the
Tepper School. It is this shared environment of the Tepper School that best communicates and differentiates our
uniqueness as a special learning place to earn an undergraduate degree. We must continually protect and
nurture our community environment for all of us.

### Tepper School Undergraduate Programs Office

The Undergraduate Programs Office is open 8:30-5p, M-F and is in suite 2400 in the Tepper Building. In addition
to program administration and academic advising, the Tepper School supports student clubs, professional treks,
community programs, new student orientation, and more.


## Undergraduate Programs

### Academic Advising

Each student receives an assigned academic advisor who provides clear, timely, and accurate information
concerning programs, policies, procedures, and resources. The academic advisor is the student’s first point of
contact when discussing these policies, procedures, and resources. This includes course scheduling,
concentration selection, minor declaration, additional major declaration, study abroad, transfer credit, and
more.

Advisors do not provide excused class absences. Students should work with their academic advisor, housefellow,
and Student Affairs resources if they will be away from CMU for extended time.

Economics students are assigned an advisor in the Dietrich Success Center until they declare the Economics
major. Upon declaration, they are assigned an Economics major advisor through graduation. Business
Administration students are assigned a major advisor for their first year and switch to a new advisor for upper-
class years. Students pursuing additional majors and/or minors receive their advisor assignment following their
application review.

The Tepper School fully adheres and supports the Carnegie Mellon University Statement on Advising.

### Academic Advising Appointments

The Tepper School uses ScheduleOnce to schedule advising appointments. Our staff expects that students
attend appointments as scheduled. We recognize that there are times when you are unable to make the
appointment if you are ill or have a scheduling conflict. In that case, please cancel the appointment through the
same software.

### Academic Audits: Stellic

Stellic is the University’s Academic Audit and is a student success platform for degree planning, degree, audit,
and a student’s educational plan. Stellic displays a student’s progress towards completing degree requirements
while highlighting double-counts and allowing for exceptions. While the student transcript is considered the only
official record of courses taken at CMU, Stellic is used by students and academic advisors to assess graduation
progress. Students are responsible for monitoring their own academic progress toward degree completion and
should periodically review the audit. Students should direct any questions regarding their audit to their
academic advisor.


### Academic Integrity Policies

The Tepper School and Carnegie Mellon take academic integrity seriously and expect all students to do the
same. In any manner of presentation, it is the responsibility of each student to produce their own original
academic work. Collaboration or assistance on academic work to be graded is not permitted unless explicitly
authorized by the course instructor(s). Students may utilize the assistance provided by Student Academic
Success Center and the CMU-Q Academic Resource Center unless specifically prohibited by the course
instructor(s). Any other sources of collaboration or assistance must be specifically authorized by the course
instructor(s). Students are responsible for reviewing, understanding, and adhering to the identified policies and
procedures.

Students are not eligible to drop a course if they are involved in an active academic integrity matter concerning
the course they wish to drop. The academic integrity matter must be resolved before changes to a student’s
class schedule can be pursued. The Office of Community Responsibility is the campus resource available to
students, faculty, and families to support community standards and academic integrity.

### Academic Record Review

Students should review their academic record on a regular basis using Stellic and SIO. Academic advisors will
also review student academic records as an advising appointment topic. If course information is missing from an
academic record, students should notify their academic advisor.

### Advanced Placement Credit

Students can earn course equivalency credit for qualified advanced placement scores from three sources:
Advanced Placement (AP College Board), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge Advance Level &
Edexcel Examinations. CMU does not have a maximum allowable number of advanced placement credit that
students may earn; AP credit is not factorable in the QPA calculation. Students should consult the Registrar’s
Office to determine how advanced placement credit is awarded; each department determines their own policy
and the Tepper School follows the campus guidelines. Students should discuss advanced placement with their
advisor to determine how they may use the scores within the degree requirements. If a student takes the CMU
course for which they were awarded advanced placement credit, the credit will be removed from the student
record and the earned grade for the CMU course will be recorded on the transcript. Students cannot earn credit
for both advanced placement and the equivalent course.


### Academic Standing and Actions

The Tepper School believes that each student can be successful in their academic pursuits. Academic actions
support student success and create opportunities for students to reflect and utilize additional campus resources.
Each student’s academic pathway is unique and the Tepper School is committed to partnering with students as
they learn and grow as future business leaders. At the end of each semester, a student's academic progress and
performance is reviewed to determine student standing in the next academic semester.

#### Academic Progress

In order to maintain good academic standing, Tepper students must attain at least a 2.0 minimum quality point
average for each semester (as well as cumulatively), and also make and maintain adequate progress toward
completing their degree requirements. For purposes of academic standing, default grades for incomplete grades
are considered in QPA calculations. Adequate progress towards graduation means that students are successfully
completing at least 80% of attempted units in a semester (calculated using total units carried when grades are
entered). Grades of N, W, or R grade do not count as completed units.

#### Good Standing (Departmental Status)

To graduate in eight semesters, students need to earn an average of 45 units per semester and maintain at least
a 2.0 QPA.

#### Academic Concern Status (Departmental Status)

Students who are not making adequate progress toward the degree, demonstrated either through QPA or
semester course load, will receive an academic concern notification. Receiving the letter of academic concern
notifies students that they need to engage with their advisor to reflect on their academic performance, address
their progress, and determine a plan for success. Students who receive a letter of academic concern are
required to complete an Academic Success Plan with their advisor (instructions are included in the notification).

Students with academic concern status are reviewed by the Tepper School at the end of the semester. Students
will return to good standing when they meet their academic concern expectations, earn at least a 2.0 semester
QPA, complete at least 36 units, and earn a cumulative QPA at or above 2.0.

#### Academic Warning (Departmental Status)

Students with a semester QPA below 2.0 and/or did not earn at least 36 factorable units are reviewed for
academic warning. Students with a cumulative QPA below 2.0 will also be placed on academic warning. When a
student is placed on academic warning, the Tepper School identifies expectations during the upcoming semester
to support student success that must be met. Students on academic warning are required to complete an
Academic Success Plan with their advisor (instructions are included in the notification). Students with academic
warning status are not permitted to overload.

Students with academic warning status are reviewed by the Tepper School at the end of the semester. Students


will return to good standing when they meet their academic warning expectations, earn at least a 2.0 semester
QPA, complete at least 36 units, and earn a cumulative QPA at or above 2.0.

#### Academic Suspension (University Status, Department Decision)

Students who do not meet their academic warning requirements may receive a one-year academic suspension.
When a student is academically suspended, the Tepper School remains committed to student success and works
with students on academic suspension throughout the time period to ensure a successful return and sustained
recovery during their CMU career. When a student is placed on academic suspension, they must meet with their
academic advisor and the assistant dean to develop a plan for their future success. While on academic
suspension, there are impacts for students to be aware of while away from their CMU studies.

To return from academic suspension, the Tepper School requires the student to submit material for review to
determine a student’s eligibility to return. Information about the materials required to return from academic
suspension and the deadline for submission are communicated within the academic actions letter.

#### Final Warning (Departmental Status)

Following an academic suspension, Tepper School students return on final academic warning. When a student is
placed on final academic warning, conditions are identified during the final academic warning semester that
must be met to support student success. Students on final academic warning are required to complete an
Academic Success Plan with their advisor (instructions are included in the notification) and follow additional
conditions outlined by the Tepper School. Students with final academic warning status are reviewed by the
Tepper School at the end of the semester. Failure to meet final academic warning conditions may lead to an
academic drop from the Tepper School.

#### Drop (University Status)

Drop means permanent expulsion from the Tepper School. This normally follows a student’s failure to meet
minimal academic performance while on final probation following academic suspension.
Appeals

Students have the right to appeal Academic Actions Committee decisions to the Tepper School Dean or their
appointed designee. All appeals must be received in writing by the deadline printed in the academic standing
notification. Additional information about appealing an academic action decision is found in _The Word: Student
Handbook._

### Auditing a Course

Undergraduate students are permitted to audit courses as defined in the Undergraduate Catalog. Students
should consult with their academic advisor about this option.


### Course Drop

Students are permitted to drop a course before or on the drop deadline (as published in the Academic
Calendar). When a course is dropped, the course is removed from the student schedule and does not appear on
the academic record. Students are responsible to review the Academic Calendar to understand the drop
deadlines. The University Registrar’s Office publishes and administers the drop policy and process.

The late drop voucher system permits a limited number of late course drops after the drop deadline.
Undergraduate students can use three drop vouchers over the course of their undergraduate career and may
use only one voucher per semester (including summer). Students must confirm the late drop voucher in SIO
within 24 hours of receiving the automated voucher email. Courses dropped using a voucher are removed from
the student's record. Students may use drop vouchers up until the last day of classes each semester. Students
wishing to use a late drop voucher must consult with their assigned academic advisor about the decision; the
advisor initiates the process for the student after the advising appointment.

### Course Grade Change Appeal Process

Students requesting grade appeals must follow the CMU policy. The grade change appeal policy is posted in the
_The Word: Student Handbook_. Tepper advisors are not involved with grade change requests as this is something
between the student and faculty member.

### Course Grade Policies

Students must earn letter grades (A through D) for required degree courses. The only degree requirement
wherein a P grade is permitted is Core @ Carnegie Mellon (99-101) or P grades awarded in the Spring 2020
Special Pass/No Pass election. Repeating courses does not replace the previously earned grade on the transcript
and both grades are calculated into the QPA. Courses completed with a letter grade earn factorable units that
are used to compute QPA.

Each academic department adheres to its own grading policies and students are responsible for understanding
individual department grading policies.

### Course Load

All undergraduate students must carry at least 36 units per semester to maintain full-time enrollment status.
Students generally need to carry at least 45 units per semester to graduate within eight semesters. Students
must meet with their academic advisor if they are considering dropping below 36 units and receive approval
from their college to proceed below 36 units. International students are required to be enrolled full-time each
semester to maintain their visa status. F-1 and J-1 students who are considering dropping below full-time must


consult with the Office of International Education to determine eligibility for reduced course load authorization;
failure to do so will result in the loss of legal immigration status.

### Course Registration

Students register for classes using Student Information Online (SIO). Registration times are determined by the
university based on student class levels and rotate throughout a student’s undergraduate career. The Tepper
School expects students to meet with their advisor prior to course registration and to use SIO to plan their
course schedules.

### Course Waitlists

Students are often waitlisted for courses. Primary majors in Business Administration and Economics have
priority in their respective major courses. Students on waitlists are added to courses based on academic major,
class level, their place on the waitlist, and available space. Students pursuing a Tepper additional major or a
Tepper minor receive waitlist priority over students from other academic departments who are not pursuing any
Tepper affiliated degree.

Each department at Carnegie Mellon handles waitlists differently as described in the waitlist policy. When
prompted by the University Registrar’s Office, if you want to remain on the waitlist, you should “tag up” to
maintain your place on the waitlist. “Tag up” is a term used at Carnegie Mellon wherein students receive an
email notification asking them if they wish to remain on a course waitlist. To “Tag up,” students indicate if they
want to stay on the course waitlist.

Here is the Waitlist Wisdom applicable for all students:

```
● There is no guarantee that you will be added to a course just because you are on the waitlist.
```
```
● Waitlists do mean "wait," you must be patient about your course schedule. Please note that if you are on a
waitlist, you may not have an update about your waitlist status until the beginning of the semester.
```
```
● A course may appear to have open seats but will prompt with a waitlist. When this happens, it is because
there are seats reserved for students in other departments.
```
```
● Your number on the waitlist does not necessarily mean that it is the order in which you will be enrolled in
the course.
```
```
● Academic advisors do not manage waitlists but can consult with you about your waitlist status and your
academic schedule.
```
```
● Tepper instructors do not manage waitlists and should not be contacted about a waitlist status.
```

```
● You cannot add yourself to a waitlist for a different section of a course in which you are already enrolled.
```
```
● You should have a back-up plan when you register so that if a course is full, you have other options for the
semester and don't have to add yourself to a waitlist. Registering for a different course that has available
spots and still is a good choice for your semester is often the best option when facing a waitlist.
```
### Course Withdrawal

After the drop deadline, students may withdraw from a course. When a course is withdrawn, the course is
assigned a W grade and appears on the transcript. The units remain for the withdrawn course but the W grade
does not factor into the QPA calculation. The withdrawal deadline in each semester is published in the Academic
Calendar. Students who wish to withdraw from a course need to complete the University Registrar’s Office
course withdrawal form, meet with their advisor to discuss the withdrawal, and submit the form to their advisor.

### Cross-Registration PCHE Courses

The Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) allows students to cross-register at a local institution in the
fall or spring semester. Cross-registered course grades count towards the semester unit maximum total, follow
the CMU residency requirements, and factor into the student QPA. If the same course is offered at Carnegie
Mellon in the same semester, the Tepper School requires the student to take the course at Carnegie Mellon.

### Curriculum Requirements

Curriculum requirements for the Economics and Business Administration majors are found in the Undergraduate
Course Catalog. The year that students enter CMU dictates which Undergraduate Course Catalog they must
follow. Students who complete an internal transfer should consult with their academic advisor to confirm their
curricular requirements.

### Dean's List

Tepper students who earn at least a 3.75 QPA with at least 36 factorable units (while receiving no conditional
grades of “I” for Incomplete) receive Dean's List honors in fall and spring semesters. The Dean’s List is published
on the Tepper School website.

### Dual Degree

To earn a dual degree, students must complete a minimum of 90 units for the dual degree in addition to the
units required for their primary degree. Students must also complete both sets of general education


requirements.

Tepper students interested in pursuing a dual degree should discuss their plans with the academic department
offering the dual degree. Students must meet all requirements for both the dual degree and the Tepper degree
(including concentration requirement for business majors). The student's dual degree will substitute for the
primary major's minor requirement provided it is completed prior to or at the same time as the primary degree.

Non-Tepper students intending to pursue a Tepper School dual degree are required to apply for the dual degree
and encouraged to consult with the assistant dean about their interests and application process. Students must
meet all requirements for the Tepper major including the University Core (and concentration requirement for
business dual degree). The student's primary degree will substitute for the dual degree's minor requirement
provided it is completed prior to or at the same time as the dual degree. Dual degree students receive a second
diploma and are invited to attend the Tepper Diploma Ceremony.

### General Education: University Core

Students should consult their academic catalog for the general education requirements needed to fulfill their
degree requirements. For students who entered CMU prior to Fall 2020, the Tepper School requires the
completion of Breadth requirements. For students who enter CMU in Fall 2020 and later, the Tepper School
requires the completion of University Core requirements. Courses may double count toward a general education
requirement and toward a minor or additional major.

### Graduate Study Opportunities

Students who are interested in a graduate degree may wish to consider an accelerated degree offered through
the University. Students should consult the Course Catalog for available accelerated degree programs.

### Graduation Requirements and Participation

In order to graduate, students must meet all course requirements specified for the program (listed in the
Undergraduate Course Catalog specific to the student’s entering year), earn a 2.00 or higher cumulative QPA,
and complete the required number of earned factorable units. Students must also meet all university residence
requirements and all university financial obligations before being awarded the degree and diploma. Students
with less than 36 units remaining to complete in their undergraduate degree requirements are eligible to
participate in the diploma ceremony. In this situation, students participate in the event but do not receive their
degree and diploma until all degree requirements, university residence requirements, and all financial
obligations are met.


### Honors Thesis for Primary and Additional Majors

The Tepper School grants College Honors to graduating students who complete a senior honors thesis. The
thesis is a two-semester research project with a written thesis as a final product and a presentation at the
University’s _Meeting of the Minds_ research symposium in May. Eligible students must have at least 75% of their
undergraduate course units completed. The honors thesis is 18 units in total and students receive College
Honors upon graduation. Non-Tepper students pursuing Tepper additional majors may apply for the Tepper
School’s College Honors.

### Incomplete Grades

Incomplete grades are an option in limited situations where a student has completed at least 75% of course
work. Students who receive an Incomplete grade(s) work with their faculty member to identify the incomplete
work and an agreed upon timeline for completing the work. Students who receive an Incomplete (I) grade are
reviewed for academic progress. The default grade assigned to an Incomplete grade will be considered in the
academic actions review. To learn more about Incomplete Grades, students should consult the _Undergraduate
Catalog_.

### Independent Study

The Tepper School supports student research through credit-earning independent study with CMU faculty
members. Students must be in good academic standing to be eligible for independent study. Students can earn
between three and nine units of independent study for a factorable grade. The nine units are agnostic to which
department awards them unless the Independent Study units are a requirement for a minor or additional major.
Independent study cannot be used as a substitute for an existing course in the undergraduate catalog and
cannot be a substitute for a curriculum requirement.

All independent study plans require the active involvement of a CMU faculty advisor who is responsible for the
course structure and content activities, evaluation criteria, and final grade determination. Only one independent
study is applied to the degree requirements. The independent study application must be received by or on the
add deadline of the semester during which the study is anticipated.

### Integrated and Accelerated Master Degree (3-1 -1 programs)

Integrated and Accelerated Master’s Degree programs enable undergraduate students to earn both an
undergraduate degree and a master’s degree by remaining one additional year at Carnegie Mellon. Integrated
and Accelerated Master's Programs represent a considerable savings in cost and time. Students attain further
breadth and/or depth of knowledge in their area of study, broadening their post-graduation career
opportunities.


The Tepper School of Business offers an integrated and accelerated Master of Business Administration (MBA) to
CMU undergraduate students completing either a Business Administration major or an additional major in
Business Administration. Students complete 3 years as a CMU undergraduate, followed by 1 year of integrated
undergraduate and graduate study, followed by 1 full year of graduate MBA coursework at Tepper. This allows
students to complete the two degrees within 5 years.

To be admitted to the program, students must have applicable work or internship experience and have attained
grades of B or higher in the following courses: 70-257, 21-257 or 21-292; 73-102; 70-122; 70-371; 70-381; and
70-391. Students must apply and be admitted to the Tepper MBA program by applying during junior year.

### Internships for Academic Credit

The Tepper School offers students the opportunity to earn academic credit for business and economics-related
internships. This is a credit-bearing course and tuition is assessed for the internship course. Students can apply
for the internship course, 70499 or 73-111, in the fall, spring, or summer terms once they have secured a
business or economics-related internship. These courses are offered for three units as Pass/No Pass grade
option only; the internship course does not fulfill a course requirement in the major. To enroll in an internship
course, students must:

```
● Be enrolled in a Tepper major, additional major, or minor;
```
```
● Be in good academic standing;
```
```
● Provide an offer letter from the internship location;
```
```
● Provide a one-paragraph description of the internship and the application of business knowledge within
the internship.
```
International students who want Curricular Practical Training (CPT) credit for the internship must submit the
Tepper School internship course application for CPT, internship offer letter, and internship description by the
add deadline and meet all requirements designated by the Office for International Education. Only Tepper
primary majors and additional majors can apply for CPT through the Tepper School.

Non-Tepper students who have not yet declared the additional major and wish to enroll in an internship course
must have at least 60% of the additional major course work completed prior to the current semester and at least
70% of the additional major course work must be completed at the end of the current semester.


### Leave of Absence

The Tepper School is committed to each student’s success as they progress through the degree requirements.
There may be times when it is in the student’s best interest to consider a Leave of Absence in consultation with
their academic advisor. W grade assignments are assigned by the academic program depending on the
circumstances and timing of the Leave of Absence. When a student elects a Leave of Absence, the program
remains committed to student success and works with the student throughout the time away in targeted ways
to ensure a successful return to CMU. Students preparing to return from a Leave of Absence will work with the
Assistant Dean and academic advisor to submit the required University paperwork and prepare for a successful
return.

### Major Change within the Tepper School

Students pursuing an Economics+Mathematics major must first be declared as a B.S. in Economics student.
Interested students apply for the B.S. in Economics+Mathematics through a separate application process and
must meet the following criteria:

```
● Cumulative QPA of at least 3.
```
```
● Completed 73-
```
```
● Earned a "B" or better in 21-127 or 21-
```
```
● Earned a "B" or better in 21-
```
```
● Earned a "B" or better in 73-
```
```
● Earned a "B" or better in either 73-230 or 73-
```
Students interested in changing their major to Computational Finance must complete the BSCF application
process available through the CMU Mathematics program and should have taken or be currently enrolled in
courses along with the other application elements:

```
● 21127 or 21128
```
```
● 21241 or 21242
```
```
● 21270
```
Students with a current Business Administration or Economics major who wish to change to one of the other
Tepper majors is eligible to change their major after completing a complete fall or spring semester within their
currently declared major. For example, a student who changes their major to Economics in March is not eligible
to change their major to Business Administration until the following spring semester after the fall semester


ends. A student who begins the fall semester studying Business Administration is eligible to change to Economics
at the start of the following spring semester.

### Pass Grades

Completing a course with a passing grade of “P” results in earning the units for the course but does not mean
that a course meets a degree requirement. Students who wish to request a “P” grade for an academic course
should consult with their academic advisor and must follow the University’s procedures identified in the
Undergraduate Catalog.

Coursework earning final grades A, B, C, or D receive credit for units passed and are recorded as “P” on the
student's academic record; below D work receives no credit and are recorded as “N” on the student's academic
record. No quality points are assigned to “P” or “N” units; “P” or “N” units are not factored into the student’s
QPA. Students also have the option to elect a Pass/No Pass voucher and must meet with their academic advisor
to pursue this option.

### Policy Exemption Requests

Students requesting an exemption to policies must complete the Exemption to Policy Request Form available
from their academic advisor and return the form to their advisor for consideration. Responses to such
exemptions are communicated in writing to the student.

### Student Communications

It is important that students read and understand communications that come from the Tepper School to ensure
they are aware of academic policies, processes, and deadlines. Students are expected to take responsibility for
reading communications. Email newsletters are published each Monday in the fall and spring semesters and
include academic, club, and career events and information. Email announcements are also used to communicate
key information to students. Tepper utilizes Canvas to promote events, announcements, and information;
students are automatically enrolled in the Tepper Undergraduate Canvas site.

### Student Defined Major

Carnegie Mellon offers the opportunity for undergraduate students to pursue a University Student-Defined
Major (SDM). Students interested in this opportunity should begin by speaking with the Assistant Dean. The
Tepper School requires students pursuing the SDM to be in good academic standing at the time the SDM is
approved by Tepper as the home college.


### Study Abroad

Tepper students have an array of study abroad programs available to them. Tepper offers Departmental
Exchange Programs with business schools abroad, and many other options can be explored through CMU’s
Study Abroad Portal. Students interested in study abroad programs should consult with a study abroad advisor
in the Office of International Education and their academic advisor about the location, courses to study, and
appropriate timing. Some study abroad programs have specific QPA requirements that must be met; for
programs without a defined QPA requirement, the Tepper School requires students to have a cumulative QPA of
2.0 or higher to pursue a study abroad experience.

Students work with the Office of International Education to complete the Study Abroad Transfer Credit (SATC)
Form, which is required for all CMU students, prior to departure. Students must have their courses reviewed for
equivalency through the transfer credit review process and study abroad transfer credit must align with transfer
credit policies. If course plans change, the student must update the SATC form.

### Tepper Building Room Reservations

Student clubs affiliated with the Tepper School Undergraduate Programs receive priority in reserving space in
the Tepper building. Tepper student clubs receive instructions for room reservations through the Tepper
Undergraduate Programs Office. Individual students and non-affiliated student organizations can request space
across campus through 25Live.

### Tepper Graduate Course Enrollment

Tepper seniors with a cumulative QPA of 3.5 or higher may be eligible to enroll in Tepper graduate courses. An
application for graduate course enrollment does not guarantee enrollment; MBA core courses are not available
for undergraduate enrollment. Students who are interested in this option should speak with their academic
advisor. This is a very limited option due to graduate enrollments.

### Tepper Minors

The Tepper School offers minors in Business Administration, Business Analytics and Optimization, Economics,
Financial Management, Operations and Supply Chain Management, Product Management, and Innovation &
Entrepreneurship (as an IDeATE minor). Eligibility to declare one of these minors varies and students should
consult the course catalog for additional information. Students enrolled in one of these minors are required to
adhere to the same grading policies as primary majors. This includes the minimum QPA, letter grades for degree
required courses, and the repeating courses. Upon completion of the minor degree requirements, the Tepper


School certifies the minor and it is recorded on the academic transcript; minors do not appear on a student’s
diploma per University policy.

If a student pursues a business minor that requires 73102 and receives a prerequisite waiver for 73102, 9
additional units of elective course work (70xxx) is required to ensure 54+ units are met in the minor curriculum.

If a student pursues an economics minor and receives a prerequisite waiver for 73102, 9 additional units of
elective course work (73xxx) is required to ensure 54+ units are met in the minor curriculum.

### University Honors

Students who earn a final cumulative QPA of 3.50 or higher graduate from Carnegie Mellon with University
Honors and are recognized at Commencement activities.


## Business Administration Policies

### Additional Major in Business Administration

Students interested in pursuing the additional major in Business Administration should consult the course
catalog for degree requirements and meet the following requirements before submitting the application form:

```
● Completion of a Tepper School Minor in Business Administration
```
```
● 70-207: Probability and Statistics for Business Applications (or equivalent)
```
```
● 21-120: Differential and Integral Calculus
```
Students enrolled in the additional major in business administration must adhere to the same grading and
academic policies (listed in both the course catalog and handbook) as primary majors. Upon completion of the
additional major degree requirements, the Tepper School certifies the additional major and the credential
appears on the diploma.

### Concentration Requirement for Primary Majors

Students earning the business administration degree must complete the concentration and business elective
requirements per the undergraduate catalog. Students are expected to identify their chosen concentration in
Stellic by the end of sophomore year to maintain progress. Students should consult with their academic advisor
and the Career and Professional Development Center career staff about their concentration choice. Courses
taken to meet concentration requirements are not allowed to double count toward any other business
administration degree requirements, including the minor requirement.

If a student completes an additional major, the concentration requirement is waived (as is the minor
requirement). Students must then complete at least 27 units of business elective courses for their degree
requirements if they earn an additional major as part of the waived concentration requirement.

Students who select the product management concentration who are also earning a minor or additional major
in HCII will have the HCII course in the concentration waived. To meet the concentration requirement, these
students will be required to take one additional elective course from the Tepper course listing in the product
management concentration. This is the only approved exception for the product management concentration.

### Course Double Counts

Students cannot double count courses within the Business Administration curriculum. Courses in the
concentration and business elective requirements are not allowed to double count against any other degree


requirement, including minor or additional major pursuits. When choosing to double-count courses between
Tepper and other academic departments, the double-count policies are determined by the other academic
department for a minor, additional major, and/or dual degree. There are no double-counting restrictions
between the minor and the student’s home college general education requirements.

Non-Tepper students earning a minor, additional major, or dual degree in Business Administration must adhere
to the policies listed in the catalog for double counting courses. There are no double-counting restrictions
between the minor or additional major and the student’s home college general education requirements.
Students pursuing multiple Tepper minors cannot double count beyond one course across the minors.

### Minor Requirement for Business Students & Additional Major Option

Students are required to complete a minor to earn the business degree, and some students choose to fulfill this
requirement with an additional major. Each college has its own process for declaring a minor/additional major;
students should work with the individual department to learn their policies. Upon official declaration of the
minor/additional major, students should regularly meet with the minor/additional major advisor and their
Tepper School advisor to ensure that they are meeting the requirements of the minor/additional major. If a
student completes an additional major, the minor requirement is waived (as is the concentration requirement).
Students must complete at least 27 plus units of business elective courses for their degree requirements if they
earn an additional major. The minor/additional major is certified by the corresponding department at the time
of graduation. Failure to complete the minor requirement will prevent a student in business administration from
graduating.

### Pass Grades

There is a limit of 9 units of “P” that students may apply toward the 364 units needed for the Business
Administration degree (this excludes Core@CM). Exceptions are available for students who earned P grades
during Spring 2020.

### Semester Course Overload

A course overload for a business student is any schedule with more than 51 units in Fall or Spring semester or
more than 24 units in Summer I or Summer II. Students must petition to receive a semester overload. For Fall
and Spring semesters, Tepper students petition to enroll in more than 51 units for the semester to total 57 units.
Students must meet the 3.5 cumulative QPA threshold to petition for an overload. Petitions are reviewed and
determined by the Tepper School. Students transferring into the Tepper School from across campus may be
required to reduce their unit load to meet the Tepper School policy of 51 units per semester. New first-year or
external transfer students are restricted to 50 units in their first semester and are not eligible to overload until


they complete one semester. A student may lose the right to overload if their QPA drops below the threshold
after an overload for the next semester has been granted.

### Transfer Credit

Courses taken at higher education institutions outside of Carnegie Mellon can be considered for transfer credit if
the course and the institution offering them meet a comparable level and rigor as determined by CMU faculty.
Transfer credit for any Carnegie Mellon course must be approved through the appropriate review processes.

Students must earn a final grade of C- or higher to receive transfer credit unless otherwise noted by an
individual approval. CMU Washington Semester and CMU-Qatar courses are exempt from the transfer course
policy; community college and online courses may be considered for transfer credit by the individual
department policies. Students pursuing the Dual Degree in Business Administration are subject to the transfer
policy for business administration primary majors.

The following courses must be taken at Carnegie Mellon:

```
● Business Science (70106)
```
```
● Business Leadership Endeavor (70104, 70204, 70304)
```
```
● Senior Capstone Management Game (70401) or equivalent
```
```
● First Year Writing (76101, 76102 or 76106, 76107 and/or 76108)
```
```
● Core@CM (99101)
```
Business students can transfer up to 90 units from higher education institutions to count towards the degree
requirements, including study abroad.

```
● Only 5 courses can be taken at U.S. institutions
```
```
● Only 2 courses can transfer to the business foundation courses requirements
```
```
● Only 1 course can transfer between the concentration and business elective course requirements
```
```
● Only 1 course can transfer to the business core course requirements
```
```
● Only 3 courses can transfer as general education courses
```
Students who complete dual enrollment college coursework during high school must be able to produce a
university/college transcript and demonstrate that the course was taught by a college/university faculty
member. Dual enrollment courses must be evaluated within the CMU equivalency processes and the courses
must fall within the current transfer policy. External transfer students admitted to the Tepper School may


transfer up to 182 units (including AP/IB credit). External transfer students are not permitted to earn additional
transfer credit with exceptions considered for study abroad.

Non-UBA students interested in pursuing a business minor/additional major can transfer:

```
● No more than 9 units toward a minor
```
```
● No more than 27 units toward the additional major requirements
```
## Economics Policies

### First Year Academic Advising

First-year students interested in economics begin as Dietrich College students and are assigned a Dietrich
Success Center (DSC) advisor. While the DSC advisors are the advisors of record until students formally declare
their majors, students who are considering majoring in economics are encouraged to speak with the Tepper
School Economics advisor so that they will have access to program resources, advising, and the community of
faculty, staff, and students.

### Graduate School Preparation

The life of a researcher (whether in academia or in the private research sector) requires a set of skills that
undergraduate students begin to acquire through course work, research, and focused conversations with faculty
and advisors. Doctoral programs in economics are looking for specific analytical skills. Key determinants of
acceptance into these programs are the choice of courses, student achievement, research experience, graduate
school entrance exam test scores (specifically the GRE), and faculty recommendations. Students who are
considering pursuing a higher academic degree are encouraged to discuss their interests with their advisor.
Interested students are encouraged to consider the B.S. in Economics and Mathematical Sciences curriculum.


### Minor Requirement for BA/BS Economics Students & Additional Major Option

Students who entered CMU in fall 2023 or later are required to complete a minor to earn the BA or BS in
Economics, and some students choose to fulfill this requirement with an additional major. Each college has its
own process for declaring a minor/additional major; students should work with the individual department to
learn their policies. Upon official declaration of the minor/additional major, students should regularly meet with
the minor/additional major advisor and their Tepper School advisor to ensure that they are meeting the
requirements of the minor/additional major. If a student completes an additional major, the minor requirement
is waived. The minor/additional major is certified by the corresponding department at the time of graduation.
Failure to complete the minor requirement will prevent a student in business administration from graduating.
