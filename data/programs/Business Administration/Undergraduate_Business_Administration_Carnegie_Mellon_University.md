The Business Administration Major in the Tepper School of Business is for students interested in a broad undergraduate education based on management science, quantitative reasoning, leadership development, and communications skills. The curriculum is rigorous and flexible to accommodate student interests, academic, and career goals. 

Students who complete the B.S. in Business Administration will be able to: i) Demonstrate a depth of knowledge in business functional areas; ii) Solve business problems using analytic methods; iii) Use diverse and broad intellectual frameworks to solve problems; iv) Develop judgment and the ability to work in diverse environments; and v) Communicate effectively and persuasively.

The curriculum includes a central core of courses in the functional areas of business, economics, mathematics, communications, and university courses in liberal arts and sciences. Students complete an in-depth study in one functional business concentration and additional business electives. Students also complete a minor from outside the Tepper School of Business to enhance their business education. The minor promotes students' intellectual confidence and leads to the broad knowledge that can last a lifetime. The curriculum structure helps Tepper graduates become leaders in complex global business, technical, and political environments.

  
Beyond the major in Business Administration, the Tepper School offers minors and additional majors to students in other programs of the university.
