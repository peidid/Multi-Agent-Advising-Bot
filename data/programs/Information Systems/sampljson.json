    "DESCRIPTION":"This course provides students with the concepts and techniques to design and develop innovative mobile applications. Students will develop a series of smaller mobile applications in weekly lab sessions using either iOS or Android frameworks. In addition, student teams will build a larger mobile application, as part of a semesterlong project, that fills a demand not effectively met in the current market. In the process of developing these applications, students will gain a strong understanding of mobile application development, mobilecentered design, the process of creating and testing innovative application design, and larger principles of software engineering. In weekly labs, students can choose either the SwiftiOS or KotlinAndroid track to complete course work, but lectures will primarily use Swift to illustrate larger points of software architecture and engineering. This course is open only to seniors in the IS major who have completed 67373 or by special permission of the instructor.",

You will learn about valuecreation in the service sector and a humancentered design process including brainstorming, storyboarding, interviewing, video sketches, and pitching. Students work in small, interdisciplinary teams to discover unmet needs of users. They conceive of a digital service and assess its technical feasibility, financial viability, and desirability. Then they  produce a plan with a business model and a video sketch and pitch it to industry professionals. Grades will be determined primarily by the quality of the teams products.",

    "DESCRIPTION":"Startup engineering is critical to innovation.  The skills required to effectively prototype, launch, and scale products are vital to engineers everywhere, from fledgling companies founded in dorm rooms to local midsize companies to internal startups from multinational tech giants.  However, developing software in a startup environment poses unique engineering challenges.  These challenges include making and justifying foundational architectural and technical decisions despite extreme uncertainty rapidly prototyping and evaluating new ideas and features, while building minimum viable products prioritizing engineering effort in severely constrained environments and communicating effectively both within a small engineering team and with internal and external nontechnical stakeholders.  This course teaches the skills necessary to engineer successfully in a startup environment, through lectures, group projects, case study discussions, and guest speakers drawn from experienced, practicing startup engineers. This is an engineeringfocused course no entrepreneurship background is required or expected.  Students do not need to have a startup idea to participate fully.",

    "DESCRIPTION":"This course will complement the technical and diagnostic skills you have learned in other courses. A basic premise of the course is that, while you will need analytical skills to discover optimal solutions to problems, you will also need a broad array of negotiation skills to implement these solutions and make sure that they are truly effective. Your longterm effectiveness  both in your professional and personal life  is likely to depend on your negotiating abilities. This course will give you the opportunity to develop these skills experientially and to understand the analytical frameworks that underlie negotiations.

Beyond hiring and promotions, these skills will help students advocate for themselves and handle a variety of challenging situations. We all struggle with some soft skills areas, but those skills can be identified and improved. This mini course allows students an opportunity to focus on these soft skills in three major areas building consensus, inspiring change, and embracing confrontation. Students practice soft skills throughout the course, and are expected to participate in reflection journaling, individual and group projects, and discussions, activities, games and simulations in class.  An understanding of Information Systems in the enterprise is preferred. This course has some space available to students outside of the Information Systems program.",
