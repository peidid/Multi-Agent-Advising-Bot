## 5 Known Issues & Feedback

The systems used for advising and university processes are not perfect. This section collects issues
we have found, and suggestions for improvement when possible.

### 5.1 S3/SIO

```
● Counting the 360 units for graduation in S3 is wrong. (E.g. StuCos and Courses repeated count
twice)
● Grades are not processed at the right time
● It is super slow
```
### 5.2 Stellic

```
● Counting the 360 units for graduation in Stellic is wrong (number of courses and units does not
match those counted manually). Stellic added a "Degree Check" requirement for QIS students as
a workaround. It seems to work.
● Some courses need to add the double counting manually.
● Programs in Stellic (the cards that appear when one clicks on the "Programs" link on the left
menu) correspond to degrees in S3. Each program in Stellic might have different audits that apply
to different students (e.g. different entry years or campus), and such audits only exist on Stellic.
```
### 5.3 University Processes

```
● The process of declaring minors and concentrations by sending forms and emails to Jarrin seems
to be too complicated.
