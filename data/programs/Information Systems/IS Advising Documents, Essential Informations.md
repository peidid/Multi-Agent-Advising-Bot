### 3.3 Managing Courses

#### 3.3.1 Dropping, Withdrawing, Pass/Failing

A drop equals the course and its load "vanishing". Any other option, where a letter grade is assigned
(A to R, X, P, N, I), is counted in the "load". Now, for those counted in the load, only A to R, and X are
factorable, which means they have quality weights that enter the QPA calculation. The other grades are
not factorable and do not impact the QPA (but count towards the load).
**Dropping**
A dropped course disappears from the student's transcript. If a student wants to drop a course, here
are some things for you to consider:
● Will the student become part-time? (Students can be part time with an exception from the
Associate Dean for Education. If they go part time without such an exception, they will go on
probation.) Approval is not common.
● How does the course affect student progress towards the major? Can the student drop a different
course that has fewer effects?
● Dropping a course because the student will not be getting an A (or B... or C) requires a reality
check with the student. Try to discourage them from "QPA Sculpting", especially when it will
impact their future semesters.
● Dropping and Withdrawing before the deadlines can be done by the student themselves on S3.
(Unless they are a freshman, then ask them to email Jarrin and copy their advisor.)
● Dropping a course with a pending or reported academic integrity violation is prohibited. (New
rules effective 26 Aug 2024.)


```
Withdrawing
● After the drop deadline, the student can still withdraw from the course by the 10th week of
classes (check calendar). Withdrawing after that deadline is not allowed (even with a voucher).
● Withdrawn courses are still in the transcript, with grade W.
● Withdrawn courses count as units taken in the semester.
● Withdrawing from a course with a pending or reported academic integrity violation may be
possible with a series of approvals. (New rules effective 26 Aug 2024.) To do that, please consult
with Dina Al-Abdi (Office of Community Responsibility Academic Integrity Liaison).
Pass/failing
● P/N courses will count towards the total number of units.
● P/N courses will not count for any major or minor requirements.
```
#### 3.3.2 Vouchers

Each undergraduate student receives three vouchers for their time at CMU. The voucher allows a
student to drop or P/NP a course up until the last day of classes. The student can use only one voucher in
any semester.
The deadline for using a voucher is set and enforced by the registrar in Pittsburgh and is not flexible.
You can’t “back date” the request after the deadline like you can with some forms.
Instructions:
● A student wishing to drop a course after the deadline must first consult with their academic
advisor. It is important to note that vouchers are not intended to be used for exceptional or
extenuating circumstances.
● After consultation, the academic advisor will initiate a drop voucher request in S3.
○ S3→ Student Page → Academic Records→ Registration: Student Registration→ Click on
the wheel by the course name.
● After the request is initiated by the advisor, the student will receive an automated email
requesting that they confirm the voucher information is correct within SIO (by selecting 'Official
Schedule' under the 'Registration' tab, and clicking 'Confirm Drop'). The student will have 24
hours to confirm the drop; otherwise, the course will remain on their record.
Please note that students who face family, health or other personal crises will be considered on
an individual basis as they are today and will not be required to use a voucher for such emergencies.

#### 3.3.3 Course repeats

```
● Only one set of units of a course counts for graduation requirements.
● Some repeats may count as separate courses (e.g. independent studies and thesis).
```
#### 3.3.4 Waitlists

```
● Cleared in the beginning of the semester by associate area head.
● Students are placed on waitlists to give priority to other students (in major, for example).
● You, the advisor, can see the waitlist and roster for any class in S3. This can help you give your
students an idea of where they sit and their chances of getting in. You can also email the AAH for
a given program and just ask them their opinion on the waitlist for a given course.
● If a student needs an overload or has a schedule conflict, they cannot be automatically added to
a course they were waitlisted for. In this case, if they are allowed in the course, they will receive
```

```
an email with an invitation to solve the conflict and register. Note that there will be a deadline for
registering.
```
#### 3.3.5 Overloading

**Definition:** Overloading refers to taking more than the equivalent of 5 full-semester courses in the Fall or
Spring semester, typically registering for more than 52 units in a semester.
**● Exceptions:**
○ StuCo (Student College) courses and Physical Education courses are not counted toward
this limit.
**Approval Process:**
Students who wish to overload must:

1. Consult their IS Advisor to discuss their plan.
2. Review the policy and complete the Dietrich College Petition to Carry an Overload form.
3. Schedule an appointment with the IS Academic Advisor for final review and approval.
Important Notes:
● Meeting eligibility requirements does not guarantee approval to register for an overload.
● Typically, students will be allowed to overload by no more than one additional full-semester
course, or its equivalent.
● If a standard 5-course load exceeds 52 units, overloads to accommodate the additional units will
generally be permitted.
Students are encouraged to plan carefully and consult their advisor before requesting an overload.

### 3.4 Special Courses

#### 3.4.1 Independent Studies

Independent studies allow IS majors to advance their knowledge in specific areas of interest under faculty
supervision.
● **Credit Options:**
○ Students can enroll for **3, 6, 9, or 12 units** of academic credit.
○ Course numbers:
■ **67-390 and 67-393** (regular independent studies)
■ **67-391** (for late enrollments after the add deadline)
○ The course section is determined by the faculty sponsor.
● **Approval Process:**
○ **Find a faculty sponsor** to guide the study, define its academic scope, and evaluate
progress.
○ **Complete and submit the application form** to an IS advisor (Brandy Wilson, Correy
Dandoy, or Gary DiLisio – Hamburg Hall 3031).
○ An IS advisor will **add the course to your schedule** upon approval.
● **Requirements to Receive Credit:**
○ The research area must be **related to information systems.**
○ The faculty sponsor must be **affiliated with the IS Program.**
○ The application must be submitted by the **end of the first week of classes.**
○ Assignments, due dates, progress reviews, and grading criteria must be **established
before submission.**


○ Students must be **enrolled in the independent study course** while conducting the
work.
○ Regular contact with the faculty sponsor is expected, requiring a **serious commitment.**
Students interested in independent studies should proactively arrange their project and maintain
consistent engagement with their faculty mentor.

#### 3.4.2 StuCo Courses

```
● Up to 9 credits counts towards 360 units.
```
#### 3.4.3 Cross Registration

● See: https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-services/cross-registration/
● Cross-registration is open to full-time students at the sophomore level and higher.
● Full-time students may cross-register for one course per semester.
● When cross-registered, students must adhere to the host school’s academic calendar (start date,
drop/withdrawal deadlines, final exam, etc.).
● The final grade that the host school reports will appear on the home transcript.
● The final grade will factor into the student’s QPA.
If a student wants to use a cross-registered course for one of their requirements, they need to provide
the syllabus of the course and get authorization from the Area Head, who works with Pittsburgh to make
sure the course fulfills the expectation of the category.

### 3.5 Probation, Suspension, or Expulsion

```
● Causes: lack of progress towards the degree, QPA, Academic Integrity, fall below full-time, or
other severe violations.
● QPA-related:
○ Probation if 1.75 or less in Freshman year, or below 2.0 in other semesters.
○ A student goes on suspension if already on probation and semester QPA is below 2.0.
● Progress related guidelines (this is not an automatic probation, depends on case):
○ Has not finished all core 100 level courses by the end of sophomore year;
○ Has not finished all core 200 level courses by the end of junior year;
○ Has attempted core courses twice and not passed (if a student drops a course in the
beginning of the semester, it is not a real attempt).
```
### 3.6 Changing Major

```
● See: https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/cmuq-policy-on-changing-majors/
● Ask students to coordinate with the associate area head of the destination major.
● Official applications are processed at the end of year only, but in practice students can start
working towards the destination major prior to transfer (as long as the destination major agrees).
● Students cannot be on probation to officially transfer.
● Until an official transfer is in place, the home major advisor is still the primary advisor. The advisor
is responsible for:
○ verifying that the student is in touch with the destination major AAH (e.g. confirmation
email from AAH);
○ informing the student that, until the transfer takes place, they are still in the original major
and should be aware of any delay expected if they choose to continue with the original
major, or are not admitted to the destination major.
```

### 3.7 Alternative Majors

If a student cannot finish their original major, but they have enough credits and courses in other
topics, they might benefit from graduating in a student-defined major or bachelor's in general studies. For
more information about those options, check the links below.
● Bachelor's in General Studies: Interdisciplinary Programs < Carnegie Mellon University
● Student Defined Major: Undergraduate Options < Carnegie Mellon University

### 3.8 Campus exchange
