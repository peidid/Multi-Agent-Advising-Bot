## 2. IS Requirements

### If a student want to graduate with IS degree, he ore she must complete both IS_degree requirements and IS general education requirement successfully.  

The best way to check the progress of a student regarding their requirements for the major, minor, or
concentration is through Stellic.
Even if the student has not yet declared a minor or concentration, they are able to add the
requirements of the chosen program to their Stellic page, and it will automatically check which
requirements are already fulfilled with the courses taken or planned by the student so far. To add a minor
or concentration, the student or advisor can go to the student's page, and click on "+ add program" at the
top, and a search box will appear. Programs that are only added on Stellic but not officially declared will
have the tag "Not Declared" next to it.
Unfortunately, double counting rules for minors (and concentrations) in Stellic are almost all wrong.
We are working to inherit the audits from Pittsburgh to fix this. In the meantime, always double check in
the minor information or with the minor advisor. If you find inconsistencies between what Stellic is
computing and what the official requirement states, please contact the Associate Area Head.

### 2.1 IS Students

The official requirements for a student to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Information Systems
are detailed here: Official requirements - BS in Information Systems
The following is an overall summary of the requirements:
● 360 units to graduate
● Technical Core: 1 Mathematics & 3 Computer Science courses
● 8 core courses & 3 breadth courses
● General Education (aka GenEd):
○ 6 Foundations requirements
○ 5 Disciplinary Perspectives requirements
○ 2 Special Seminars requirements
● Minor or Concentration

#### 2.1.1 Foundations requirement

```
Six requirements designed to build essential competencies:
● 9 units each at least:
○ Communication
○ Data Analysis
○ Computational Thinking
○ Contextual Thinking
○ Intercultural and Global Inquiry
○ Scientific Inquiry
```
#### 2.1.2 Disciplinary Perspectives requirement

```
Five requirements providing broad knowledge across disciplines:
● 9 units each at least:
○ Humanities
○ Social Sciences
○ The Arts
○ Logic/Mathematical Reasoning
```

```
● 6 additional units from one of the following:
○ Design
○ Business
○ Engineering
```
#### 2.1 3 Special Seminars requirement

```
Focuses on transformative learning experiences:
● 9 units each at least:
○ Grand Challenge Seminar
○ Perspectives on Justice and Injustice
```
#### 2.1.4 Minors

```
● Information on available minors and how to apply, including self-defined minor:
https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-services/minor-information/.
● The student should figure out if they need to declare a minor (no hard deadline) or apply to a
minor (check deadline). They should talk to the minor advisor.
● The process is to fill out and submit the form found at the Scotty link above.
● Once the minor is declared, you and the student will be able to see it on both S3 and Stellic (or
the "Not Declared" tag on Stellic will disappear).
● Minors as Concentrations:
Students may be approved to substitute a concentration with an approved minor.
The current list of approved minors that can substitute for a concentration at CMU in Qatar
includes:
● Minor in Computer Science
● Minor in Economics
● Minor in Computational Biology
● Minor in Technology Entrepreneurship (available only in Qatar)
● Minor in Business Administration (constrained to specific courses; see Appendix for
details)
```
#### 2.1.5 Concentrations

As part of the BSc. in Information Systems, students must complete a concentration, which provides
specialized knowledge in a particular area of study.
What is a concentration?
● A concentration consists of:
○ Three advanced 9-unit courses (27 units).
○ One summative 9-unit project course or an equivalent advised research experience.
● Students may also substitute an approved minor or second major for a concentration.
● Typically, concentrations are completed during the 3rd and 4th years of study.
The departments in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences offer the following
concentrations (Undergraduate Concentrations):


● IS Concentrations (CMU in Qatar):
○ Data Science
○ Digitalization
○ Information Security and Privacy
● IS Concentrations (Pittsburgh Campus):
○ Data Analytics
○ Health Information Systems
○ Technology & Arts Enterprises
○ Technology & International Development
○ User Experience (UX) Design
Others are doable with a semester in Pittsburgh; this requires careful planning with your advisor.
To declare a concentration, students must email the Academic Program Manager at the Academic
Affairs Office in CMUQ (currently Jarrin Nevel – jfn@andrew.cmu.edu) to add the concentration to their
record on S3. A concentration is considered officially declared only when it is added to S3.
More information can be found in the IS Concentrations: Information and Guidelines document for specific
course fulfillments.

### 2.2 Non-IS Students

#### 2.2.1 IS Minor / Additional Major in IS

```
● Information Systems is not available as an additional major or minor.
```
#### 2.2.2 Dual Degree in IS

```
● Yes, it is possible for students to double major within Carnegie Mellon Qatar in computer science
and information systems, or business administration and information systems. Students should
expect an additional year of study in order to complete requirements. Students must start with
one major during their first year and then petition to double major.
