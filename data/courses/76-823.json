To explore these contestations, we will look at a series of controversies that have generated global debates about the status of women and issues like consent, freedom, and equality. We will look specifically at the close connections made between womens practices and elements of tradition, including religion. We will be reading a range of positions represented in different types of writing across genre, including scholarly writing, legal cases, media debates, films and literature.",
