The topic is of the students choice but must have some original aspect in the question being explored, the data set, or in the methods that are used.  It must also be of sufficient academic rigor to meet the approval of a faculty advisor with expertise in the projects area.  Students enroll each semester in a 9unit independent study course with their faculty advisor for the project 70500 in the fall and 70501 in the spring.  Students and their faculty advisor develop a course description for the project and submit it for approval as two 9unit courses to the BA department.  Enrollment by permission of the BA Program.",
