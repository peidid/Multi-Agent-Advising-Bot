        "long_desc":  "An Independent Study course is a course taken with faculty supervision that goes beyond the courses offered in a particular area of interest. It should not duplicate a course offered in the regular schedule of classes. A student wishing to take an independent study needs to locate a faculty member whose research interests are close to the area of proposed study and meet with the faculty member to discuss whether it is something the faculty member is interested in doing. The department requires that the student and instructor submit a written contract available in the English Department detailing the expectations description of course of study, readings, how often the studentfaculty member will meet and requirements for the completed independent study project number  length of papers and a timeline for completion of the work. You should think of this as developing the equivalent of a detailed course syllabusschedule, and typically involves development of a bibliography of readings.",
