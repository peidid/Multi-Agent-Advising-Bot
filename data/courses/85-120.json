Psychology, the science that can guide this understanding, is often misunderstood by the general public. Throughout the world, when psychology is mentioned, the name that often comes to mind is Sigmund Freud. Many of the misconceptions regarding psychology started with misinterpretations of Freuds work and concepts. Using Freuds most wellknown concepts, this course will introduce students to what psychology is, and what it isnt  in hopes of illustrating what use psychological principles can be in a plethora of academic disciplines. In particular, students will learn how to apply these principles to modern day research settings with a specific focus on health and wellbeing research. Students will not only gain insight into their own academic and career paths, but into their own personality and health as well. Course work will consist of class attendance, weekly course readings and online discussions, one exam, and a final paper.",

Students will learn how popular views of psychology are often incorrect, and how the misinterpretation of the works of Freud have played into these common misconceptions. Discuss the correct meanings of common psychoanalytic concepts such as the unconscious, the id, ego, and superego, as well as catharsis, defense mechanisms, and Freudian slips Describe how these psychoanalytic concepts are assessed in both a clinical and research setting. Explain how these concepts have been interpreted in modern psychology research, with a particular focus on health psychology. Students will be able to recognize the connections between Freudian concepts and health and wellbeing outcomes. Apply these concepts in a realword scenario. Students will learn to analyze human behavior from a psychoanalytic viewpoint in the form of a case conceptualization written assignment. Demonstrate knew knowledge through weekly discussions, which will allow them to practice critical thinking and dissemination skills.",
