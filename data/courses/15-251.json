It integrates mathematical material with general problem solving techniques and computer science applications. Examples are drawn from algorithms, complexity theory, game theory, probability theory, graph theory, automata theory, algebra, cryptography, and combinatorics. Assignments involve both mathematical proofs and programming.  NOTE students must achieve a C or better in order to use this course to satisfy the prerequisite for any subsequent Computer Science course.",
