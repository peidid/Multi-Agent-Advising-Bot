This is because Vim has a editing model that is fundamentally different from almost all other editors out there, and it takes quite a bit of understanding to truly edit text at the speed of thought. The main purpose of this course is to answer the question Why Vim We will trace the roots of the Vim editor, and explain in detail how to think in Vim, how to utilize the most out of its commands, and how people use it in practice. We will also be talking a bit about some of the traps that beginners fall into, and will intentionally avoid topics that are too misleading. This course is mostly geared towards CSECE majors who spend most of their time coding in a Cstyle language.",
