        "long_desc":  "Wuhan Chinese, or Wuhanese, is the dialect of Chinese spoken in Wuhan, the capital city of Central Chinas Hubei Province. Although Wuhan situates in Chinas central region, its dialect is an instance of Southwestern Mandarin, akin to the dialects of Sichuan, Guangxi, and Yunnan. Wuhanese provides a distinct flavor of spoken Chinese for students interested in the Chinese language and culture. In class, students will be exposed to media clips in Wuhanese and be given the opportunity to practice daytoday conversations. Because of the relative proximity to Mandarin, students who already know some Mandarin will be able to speak Wuhanese comparatively well even within this semester. However, no prior experience in Wuhanese or Mandarin is necessary, and all are welcome",
