Lectures, discussion, and assignments will offer a chance to think critically about tutoring practices and the ideologies and values on which they are based as well as ways to challenge the bias inherent in them. There will be many occasions to reflect on and evaluate tutoring skills, observe others in tutoring situations, and practice a variety of methods that consider the different needs of communicators.
