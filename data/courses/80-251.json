        "long_desc":  "This class will focus on the history of Western philosophy in the modern period, with special emphasis on the early modern era of roughly 16001800. Massive upheavals and conflicts in science, politics, and religion fueled attempts to find new ways of making sense of the world, and we will try to situate our philosophers within this rapidly evolving intellectual context. In particular, we will examine the impact of these changes on two subfields of philosophy metaphysics the study of the nature of reality, distinguishing it from mere appearance, and epistemology roughly, the study of knowledge itself. We will ask, and attempt answers for, questions like What is knowledge, can we achieve it, and if so, to what extent To what extent, if any, can our most basic scientific instruments, the human senses, lead us to the true nature of the world These questions will unavoidably send us down paths into other subfields, like philosophies of mind, of free will, of ethics, and of religion. After reading early modern philosophers like Ren Descartes, Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, John Locke, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant, we will turn to some more recent work in the modern and contemporary eras to see what lessons if any were learned, and what new approaches if any have been taken in the quest for knowledge and reality.",
