The goal of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of ballroom dancing to students and to make them comfortable in taking part in social dances.  The dances that are taught in this course include American or International forms of foxtrot, waltz, tango, chacha, rumba, and swing. Depending on the learning pace of students, we may further cover salsa and jive. Students will learn three to four basic patterns in each of the dances, the timings for each of the patterns, as well as the unique characteristics for each dance. Furthermore, students will learn the central leading and following principles of ballroom dancing. No past experience in dancing is expected just the energy and spirit for dancing",
