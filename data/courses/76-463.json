In this class students will experience this process first hand by using their previously written scripts as blueprints and transforming them into visual stories.  The focus will be on understanding the basic visual componentsusing space, tone, line, shape, color, movement and rhythm and how they are used to visually tell a story.  These visual components are used to define characters, communicate moods, emotions, thoughts and ideas.  When they are used well within a film we are not consciously aware of them but they are critical in establishing the relationship between story structure and visual structure.  Through readings, film screenings, shooting assignments and critiques this class will help each student translate their creative story into a short final film.",
