It is well known to most Americans as the language used in World War II by the United States as a means to transmit military messages with the help of Navajo soldiers, but its history and depth go far beyond that. This course aims to provide students with a way to learn the language to a basic degree, and provide foundations for learning it even more after the course has ended. In addition, this course strives to provide students with a linguistics background a unique opportunity to survey a Native American language. By the end of the course, students should walk away with the ability to describe the world and hold simple conversations in Navajo, as well as a greater understanding of Native American culture and society.",
