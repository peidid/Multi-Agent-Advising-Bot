It is well known to most Americans as the language used in World War II by the United States as a means to transmit military messages with the help of Navajo soldiers, but its history and depth go far beyond that. This course aims to provide students with a way to learn the language to a basic degree, and provide foundations for learning it even more after the course has ended. In addition, this course strives to provide students with a linguistics background a unique opportunity to survey a Native American language. By the end of the course, students should walk away with the ability to describe the world and hold simple conversations in Navajo, as well as a greater understanding of Native American culture and society.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "grade_option": {"name": "Pass/Fail", "short_name": "P", "never_graded": false, "is_pass_fail": true, "is_audit": false, "id": 4}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
