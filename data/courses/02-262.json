This course provides students with a modern research experience while training them to communicate and collaborate in an interdisciplinary setting to better prepare them to join the workforce as members of interdisciplinary teams. This will be accomplished by focusing efforts on a real research problem requiring sophisticated experimentation and computation for success. Class time will include both laboratory research time wet lab and computational and activities designed to teach and practice communication methods for interdisciplinary teams. Students are expected to have a strong background in biology or computation and an interest in both. Prerequisites include either 03117 or 03124 or 03343 or 15112 or equivalent",
