To this end, the course will explore and analyze some of the deeply held language ideologies in Arab and international contexts. Topics to be covered in the course include but are not limited to multilingualism within and across languages e.g., multidialectal practices, codeswitching between languages, language variation and change, societal and individual multilingualism e.g. language and identity, multilingualism in institutional sites e.g. schools, the work place, language policy and planning, and language rights.  The course is taught in a seminar, discussionbased format and students will construct projects to explore course topics in a handson manner. The course is taught in English and students who wish to take the course as a Modern Languages major or minor elective will need to complete their final project on a topic relevant to the language they study.",
