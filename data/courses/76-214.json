This course aims to enrich students understanding of the diversity of Arab countries and histories of intercommunal relations and conflict, explore the progress made in equating minorities to majorities, including them in various sectors, and granting them more rights. We will use readings, films, arts, and music, to engage with students in 4 Arab countries to further their learning.",
