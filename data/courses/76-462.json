The course is discussion based, and several classes per month will be devoted to generative, inclass writing exercises, which students will then work on as drafts to revise. Readings will include novels, stories, essays, and short journalistic pieces. Attendance and participation is mandatory. If youre interested in delving more deeply into the craft and art of these prose genres, and willing to put the time in to develop your own writing, this is a good class for you. I stress that a classroom is a community, and emphasis will be on establishing real connection between students. We will see how writing can help create and build on these connections between people, and serve as a tool for healing during a particularly rough time in our culture.",
