This StuCo will expose students to the basics of jump rope as a littleknown sport and have them develop creativity and skills throughout the semester. Students will perform a choreographed routine at Dancers Symposium as a final project and will also have created a simple freestyle using the skills that they have learned. There is a course fee of 6 for a jump rope. The course fee is due to the instructor in person on the first day of class. Class will be held in the Morewood Gardens Multipurpose Room.",
