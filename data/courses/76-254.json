CMU students will analyze their prospective student audience and create a humanitiesbased project with a final product to share locally with sixth through eighthgrade Arts Greenhouse students.  CMU students will engage in task analysis to break down all the steps their partner students will have to follow to create the final productproject.  Students in this course will also explore the highlights of teaching methodology to prepare them with the necessary tools to reach their middle school audience.  As a culmination of the course, college students will implement these projects in Arts Greenhouse partner schools.  Additionally, CMU students will put into practice the leadership skills necessary to build working relationships with community partners.",
