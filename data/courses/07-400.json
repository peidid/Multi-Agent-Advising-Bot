Building directly upon 15300 the prerequisite for this course, students will conduct a semesterlong independent research project, under the guidance of both the course staff and a faculty project mentor.  The course does not meet for lecture or recitations.  Instead, the students will spend their time working on their research projects, and will also meet with course staff on a biweekly basis to discuss their progress.  Students will prepare a written report and a poster presentation at the end of the semester to describe what they have accomplished.",
