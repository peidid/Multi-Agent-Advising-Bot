Special topics and many examples are drawn from areas and problems that are of interest to computer scientists and that should prepare computer science students for the probabilistic and statistical ideas they encounter in downstream courses and research. A grade of C or better is required in order to use this course as a prerequisite for 36226, 36326, and 36410. If you hold a Statistics primaryadditional major or minor you will be required to complete 36226. For those who do not have a major or minor in Statistics, and receive at least a B in 36218, you will be eligible to move directly onto 36401.",
