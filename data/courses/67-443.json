Students will develop a series of smaller mobile applications in weekly lab sessions using either iOS or Android frameworks. In addition, student teams will build a larger mobile application, as part of a semesterlong project, that fills a demand not effectively met in the current market. In the process of developing these applications, students will gain a strong understanding of mobile application development, mobilecentered design, the process of creating and testing innovative application design, and larger principles of software engineering. In weekly labs, students can choose either the SwiftiOS or KotlinAndroid track to complete course work, but lectures will primarily use Swift to illustrate larger points of software architecture and engineering. This course is open only to seniors in the IS major.",
