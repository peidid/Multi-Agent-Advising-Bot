It investigates how human societies can be organized to make the best use of natural and human resources to create economic and social justice and promote human happiness. The course will start with Plato's Republic, More's Utopia, and Bacon's New Atlantis, go on to texts like Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward and H. G. Wells's Time Machine, and then to George Orwell's 1984, Le Guin's The Dispossessed, and Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker--note the slide toward dystopias. A good deal of the term will focus on speculative fiction (aka sci fi) in the form of films as well as printed fiction, for which students can make recommendations (but Blade Runner is in for sure).  You will be expected to attend regularly with something to say about the assigned materials, write coherently about our texts (various exercises and two prepared papers), and present a \"position paper\" to the class. The course encourages a lot of imaginative play, but it also confronts serious on-going problems.", "student_sets": [], "offering_tags": [], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Fiction", "slug": "fiction", "id": 1455}, {"name": "Print Making", "slug": "print-making", "id": 1466}, {"name": "Human Resources", "slug": "human-resources", "id": 1846}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
