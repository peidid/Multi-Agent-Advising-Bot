        "long_desc":  "Political philosophers are interested in whether, and to what extent, government use of coercion can be justified.  This question involves many facets, including what gives the government the legitimate authority if any to coercively enforce the rules, what limits there are if any to the legitimate kinds of rules the government can enforce and why, what obligations if any the government has to the citizens that are governed by its rules, and what claims if any citizens of a state can make upon one another.  This course provides a systematic investigation of such questions as well as the concepts that are often appealed to in political theory, such as justice, equality, and fairness.  Readings will be comprised of classic and contemporary theorists from within the liberal political tradition as well as theorists critical of this tradition and its ability to live up to the lofty ideals it espouses.",
