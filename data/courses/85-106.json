However, humans and nonhuman animals share many aspects of their mental lives, and, upon closer inspection, some animals even reveal cognitive abilities far beyond the capacities of humans.  Through comparing and contrasting human and nonhuman cognition, we can learn about human psychological uniqueness and its evolutionary origins, and fundamental properties of cognitive processes in general",
