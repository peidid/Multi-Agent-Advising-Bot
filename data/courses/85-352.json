We will examine the relevance of evolutionary thinking to a range of psychological phenomena including problems of survival, longterm mating strategies, shortterm sexual strategies, parenting, kinship, cooperative alliances, aggression and warfare, conflict between the sexes, and prestige, status, and social dominance.
