Reflecting the inseparable relation between building and human needs, this course is not only a history of architecture, but also a history through architecture. Over the semester, we will examine architecture as a form of cultural expression unique to its time and place. Through readings and lectures, we will study the ways that the design, use, meaning, and legacy of a building and its site was conditioned not only by the architects will or the patrons desire, but also by a web of technological, religious, social, cultural, economic, and political factors of the time. There will be several exams over the course of the semester including during finals week.",
