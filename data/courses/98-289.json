        "long_desc":  "Tuesdays are hot pink. Hearing colors, tasting sounds, and feeling flavors are all different types of synesthesia, a neurological condition in which activation of one sense or cognitive pathway triggers another. For certain synesthetes, a particular smell might elicit texture and color for another, a letter might have a bright color and distinct personality. Synesthesia is rare, and those who have it often believe everyone perceives the world similarly to the way they do. As a result, the condition rarely comes up in conversation or in classes. This course will be an exploration of crosssensory perception, the different manifestations of synesthesia, and the theories behind its basis. We will compare and contrast the ways in which synesthetes and nonsynesthetes experience the world, as well as delve into some of the deeper, emotional effects of living with synesthesia.",
