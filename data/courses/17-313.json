This includes both core CS technical knowledge and the means by which this knowledge can be applied in the practical engineering of complex software in realworld settings. Topics related to software artifacts include coding, software architecture, measurement, and quality assurance of various qualities e.g., robustness, security, performance, maintainability with static and dynamic analysis, testing, code review, and inspection. Topics related to software process include requirements engineering, process models and evaluation, personal and team development, and supply chain issues including outsourcing and open source. This course has a strong technical focus, a strong focus on developing team skills, and will include both written and programming assignments. Students will get experience with the latest software engineering tools and practices.",

Figuring out what the client wants, collaborating in a team, managing complexity, mitigating risks, staying on time and budget, and determining under various constraints when a product is good enough to be shipped are at least equally important topics that often have a significant human component. 17-313 explores these issues broadly covering the fundamentals of modern software engineering. The course also puts students on a fast track toward project management positions.",
