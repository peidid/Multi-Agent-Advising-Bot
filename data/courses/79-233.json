Students will gain an understanding of how these processes were undoubtedly fostered by not only colonialism, outside intervention, and conflict, but also by indigenous knowledge production on race and ethnonational identity, national liberation, and new administrative structures and categorizations of people. The format for the course involves first, a consideration of chronological processes and general concepts of migration and displacement, and second, an investigation into weekly thematic case studies to better understand the profound impact of these events and processes to individuals, communities, and states. This will enable students to explore the local and regional manifestations of global processes leading to the creation of refugee and displaced populations in the Middle East. Special emphasis will be placed on critical reflection as to how nationalstate narratives are constructed in the Middle East as a reaction to migration and displacement. Students discussions, readings, and writing will be driven by engagement with not only academic sources but also visual and material ones, oral and recorded testimonies, and memoirs.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Cold Reading", "slug": "cold-reading", "id": 1345}, {"name": "Oil", "slug": "oil", "id": 1470}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will be able to evaluate historiographical debates about identity, belonging, and citizenship as they relate to state and nationbuilding, and their aftermath in the Middle East.", "key_topics": "This mini-course considers and interrogates numerous thematic questions, all of which help us explore not just the political or national history of displacement and refugees in the Middle East but the lived experiences of people displaced and the impact of this on community structures, culture, and even the environment.
