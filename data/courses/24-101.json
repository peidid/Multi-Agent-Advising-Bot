These projects will begin with conceptualization, proceed with the analysis of candidate designs, and culminate in the construction and testing of a prototype. The creative process will be encouraged throughout. The course is intended primarily for CIT first year students.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": "http://www.cmu.edu/me/undergraduate/index.html", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Mechanical Engineering", "slug": "mechanical-engineering", "id": 793}, {"name": "Structural Mechanics", "slug": "structural-mechanics", "id": 815}], "attributes": [{"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "24101 is the first course in the mechanical engineering major.
