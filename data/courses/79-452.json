        "long_desc":  "This course explores the fraught, often shameful, often triumphant, and sometimes deadly cultural ideas and expectations around cisgendered womens bodies. We want to explore what the stories we attach to female bodies mean, who they serve, and whether they are changeable. Are our ideas derived from science or culture And why might it matter Built from a popular U.S. basedcourse on the Pittsburgh campus, this course aims to bring feminist analysis around American cisgendered womens bodies to an audience in Doha, and asks you to build, through class discussion and assignments, your own analyses of how these ideas and concepts work in your own culture. You will no doubt come to different conclusions, which is the goal for you to think independently and analytically, to build your own ideas. The course is organized topically. We will learn some reproductive anatomy and biology including the menstrual cycle, and also survey reproductive politics, sexuality, genderbased violence, and a topic of your choice. It will be heavily discussion based. No prerequisites or prior experience with this material neededopen to all.",
