In this interdisciplinary course, students will learn how to talk to each other and strangers about identity its defining characteristics and how our bias influences our judgments. The social sciences elements will stress Social Identity Theory, bias, stereotypes, and ingroups and outgroups. The humanities elements will include closereading strategies and incorporate conceptual frameworks from cultural studies, literary studies, and narrative theory.   In addition to practicing the methodologies in these two disciplines, students will undertake two projects. In the first project, they will develop and implement a semistructured interview protocol for their campus peers centered around belonging. In the second project, students will employ close reading techniques to analyze Young Adult novels that address complex questions of identity, isolation, bias, and rejection. Working with one novel and Project 1 data, each team of social sciences, humanities, and data specialists will create a website to highlight inclusive successes and challenges. This final cohesive picture of themes pertaining to feelings of belonging on our campus will help guide the CMU community toward deeper understanding and acceptance practices.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Basic verbal and written communication practice basic introduction to framing a problem basic introduction to identifying argumentative framing basic introduction to collaborative practice.", "key_topics": "Grand Challenge Interdisciplinary First-Year Seminars in Dietrich College are team-taught courses that explore a pervasive societal problem with first year students.

These courses will include field trips, guest speakers and community building activities in the college and in collaboration with other colleges at CMU. Students build relationships with their faculty team and classmates through collaborative inquiry on socially salient topics and practice communication skills.
