Students will learn the details of western blot technique, commonly used in biology labs. In addition, they will apply the technique to study how insulin triggers specific signaling in target cells. This lab module will reinforce the students understanding of material seen in Cell Biology lecture course corequisite 03240 and will prepare them for future lab courses.",
