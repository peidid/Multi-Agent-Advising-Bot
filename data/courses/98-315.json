Should men cry Should they be tough and strong Does a man need to always hold the door open for a woman Theres a lot to talk about when it comes to being a man in America in 2017, and this course is the place to do it. Although this course is about masculinity, it is open to people of all genders. We will answer various questions about manhood from what is masculinity to where do masculinity and feminism intersect and how does my manhood intersect with other parts of my identity There is no expectation for students to have any prior knowledge or background about masculinity. This course will prove to you that being a man is about more than knowing how to change a tire.",
