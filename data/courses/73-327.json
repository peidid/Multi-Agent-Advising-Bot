Examples of important knowledge about the economy are its sources of growth, the main impulses that cause the economy to fluctuate over time and enter into booms and recessions, the way in which these impulses propagate over time, and the state of the economy in general. The main objective of this course is to lay the foundation for such an understanding and present a framework within which we can and will evaluate a variety of aggregate phenomena. Minimum grade of C required in all economics prerequisite courses.",
