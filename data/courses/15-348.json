This course covers the broad range of foundational skills that apply across all embedded computer system application areas, from thermostats to selfdriving vehicles. The emphasis is at the layer where hardware meets software. Topics include microcontroller hardware, assembly language, embedded C programming, analog IO, timers, code optimization, interrupts, and concurrency. Real world engineering practices, constraints, and example applications are integrated throughout the course. Weekly handson hardware and software experiences with an industrystrength automotive embedded controller are coordinated with the lecture content to reinforce core skills.",
