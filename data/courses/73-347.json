        "long_desc":  "An introduction to the theory of noncooperative games with an emphasis on economic applications. After an initial examination of twoperson, zerosum games, the notion of a Nash equilibrium in an nperson, noncooperative game is considered. Existence of and refinements to the equilibrium concept are discussed in the context of both normal and extensive form games. Economic applications may include various topics, including Cournot and Bertrand oligopoly models, general competitive exchange equilibrium, and free rider problems.  Lecture, 3 hours. Minimum grade of C required in all economics prerequisite courses.",
