We will strive to understand genetic principles underlying the contemporary genomic approaches to identify and characterize biological pathways dysfunctional in these diseases. In the second half of this course, we will explore the fundamental biological mechanisms of genome editing and the CRISPR system. We will also discuss technical issues that arise in use of this technology and how researchers are attempting to improve the technology. Additionally, applications of this technology to disease modeling, germ-line engineering, cell-based engineering, and disease therapy will be explored.",
