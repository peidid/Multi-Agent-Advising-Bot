        "long_desc":  "In the last three years, social media platforms have given artists and consumers of art an unprecedented platform to engage with the commercial art world as both activists and critics. 2017s trending hashtag oscarssowhite remarked on longstanding issues of inclusion within commercial filmmaking in the United States. Twitter also spread news from art worlds that were not always in the limelight like Dana Schultzs painting Open Casket at the Whitney Biennial or Kenneth Goldsmith found poem The Body of Michael Brown, read at an obscure conference at Brown University. Our course will put these and other controversies surrounding the politics of representation in the arts into broader historical and artistic contexts. We will approach the topic through particular case studies  from The Merchant of Venice to 2 Live Crews obscenity trial  that highlight the confluence of social, political and artistic forces that frame these controversial works.",
