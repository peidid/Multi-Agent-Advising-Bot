First we will conceptualize learners as readers and writers who bring diverse experiences and abilities to the classroom. We will then grapple with the questions about what we should teach our students, or which genres should students learn to write. To clarify the what question, we will consider frameworks from genrebased pedagogy, corpusbased pedagogy, and antiracist pedagogy as they apply to teaching FirstYear Writing and across disciplines. Finally, we will employ instructional design principles so that students will develop and situate their own pedagogical interventions within an existing curriculum that they have selected. Regular course requirements include brief synthesis papers of the course readings and a final project developed according to students particular interests.",
