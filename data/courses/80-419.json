This course uses a new interactive theorem prover, Lean, to explore this new technology and its logical foundations. We will study dependent type theory, a powerful and expressive language for representing mathematical objects, algorithms, and proofs. We will also consider automated methods that can be used in support of formal verification, including propositional, equational, firstorder, and higherorder methods, as well as decision procedures for real and integer arithmetic.",
