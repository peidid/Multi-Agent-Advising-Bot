In examining the rise of modern antiSemitism, we shall focus on debates over Jewish assimilation and citizenship and consider the popular impact of the print medias dissemination of conspiracy theories of Jewish world domination, including the infamous forgery, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. We will also examine cases of mass antiJewish violence, known as pogroms, in Eastern Europe and Russia, and the genocidal onslaught against European Jewry by the National Socialist regime. Finally, we will discuss the contemporary global resurgence of antiSemitism.
