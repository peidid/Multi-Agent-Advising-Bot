Some organizations show remarkable performance improvements with experience whereas others evidence little or no learning. In the course, we examine why some organizations show rapid rates of learning and others fail to learn in order to provide you the knowledge and skills to manage learning effectively. Learning involves innovating or creating new knowledge, retaining that knowledge, and transferring the knowledge throughout the firm. We examine cognitive, social, motivational and technological factors that enable organizations to create, retain, and transfer knowledge. We also analyze how firms can promote the internal transfer of knowledge while minimizing its spillover to competitors. Thus, we examine how knowledge can be a source of competitive advantage for firms. Entrepreneurial firms are a particular focus of the course because learning is so critical in entrepreneurial firms, which often have few resources other than the capabilities of their founding members. Understanding learning and how to manage knowledge effectively can enable managers to improve firm performance. Thus, the main goal of the course is to enhance your ability to increase the rate of learning and performance gains at your firm. For example, you will learn approaches and techniques for increasing creativity in organizations, for learning from experience, for developing transactive memory systems and for promoting knowledge transfer. A mix of cases, readings exercises and projects will be used.",
