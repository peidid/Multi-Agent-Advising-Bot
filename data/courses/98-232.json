Students will learn basic concepts of game creation as well as the specific tools needed to implement these concepts, namely Javascript and multiple open-source frameworks. Throughout the semester each student will develop a web game, translating the lessons in lecture to code using the Canvas (2D) and WebGL (3D) technologies. Prior programming experience on the level of 15-112 is required.",
