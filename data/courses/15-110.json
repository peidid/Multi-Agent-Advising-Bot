Data organization arrays and lists. Use of  abstraction in computing data representation, computer organization,  computer networks, functional decomposition, and application programming  interfaces. Use of computational principles in problemsolving divide and conquer, randomness, and concurrency. Classification of computational problems  based on complexity, noncomputable functions, and using heuristics to  find reasonable solutions to complex problems. Social, ethical and legal  issues associated with the development of new computational artifacts will  also be discussed.",
