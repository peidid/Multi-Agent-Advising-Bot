All these current matters fall on top of the challenging nature of electricity itself highly variable demand and renewables, hard to store efficiently and in bulk, catastrophic socioeconomic effects when blackouts occur, dependence on highly diverse primary sources of energy, etc. Multiple entities ranging from regulators implementing political decisions, operators handling daytoday operation and all the way to customers associations require for multiobjective decision making at many levels and facades of the industry, while considering the changing environment and planning for the adoption of innovation, standardization and upcoming policy. In this course all the aforementioned parameters and concerns as seen, developed and implemented by all stakeholders in the field, through both their actions and their interactions will be presented and discussed.",
