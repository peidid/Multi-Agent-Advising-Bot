Cars, aircraft, and robots are prime examples, because they move physically in space in a way that is determined by discrete computerized control algorithms. Designing these algorithms to control CPSs is challenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior. At the same time, it is vital that these algorithms be correct, since we rely on CPSs for safetycritical tasks like keeping aircraft from colliding. This course pursues the fundamental question How can we provide people with cyberphysical systems they can bet their lives on",
