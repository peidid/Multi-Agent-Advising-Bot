The topics covered will include examinations of why individuals stigmatize exploring cognitive, evolutionary, self, and system justification explanations. The course will examine the consequences of stigmatization for lowstatus groups e.g., stereotype threat, disidentification, internalization, health outcomes. We will explore the role of stigma in intergroup interactions and variation in the experience of stigma. Specific course topics will include the meaning of stigma, why people stigmatize, the physiological, cognitiveaffective and social behavioral processes linking stigma and health outcomes, and moderators of stigma.",

These, and other, manifestations can impact health and social functioning through physiological, affective, behavioral, and cognitive responses to stigma.",
