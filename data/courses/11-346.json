Students will learn to use the LightSIDE tool bench and do hands on work with provided date sets and then do a project with a data set of their own choosing. Some conceptual overview of concepts related to machine learning algorithms will be provided. Students will gain an appreciation for what machine learning is an dis not. Students will gain competence in applying machine learning technology in a purposeful manner, which includes basic data manipulations skills data structure design skills meansends analysis solid corpus based experimentation methodology evaluating and reporting results data interpretation and model interpretation error analysis hypothesis formation and sensemaking skills",
