Fossilfueled industrialization, chemical engineering, and resourceintensive consumerism have generated immense wealth, but they have also left longterm, cumulative legacies of toxic pollution and ecological harm. While these legacies affect everyone, their impacts are by no means evenly distributed. In this course, we will use the tools of anthropology, political ecology, and history to examine experiences of toxic exposure in different parts of the world, including Pittsburgh. Our analyses will ask how inequalities of race, class, gender, and ability shape exposure as well as how cultural differences create divergent understandings of ecology, health, and their interrelationship. We will consider, moreover, how these disparities shape what people know about pollution and whetherhow they demand accountability for it. Cases we explore will range from acute industrial disasters and their aftermath to the harms experienced by otherthanhuman beings to the gradual, often invisible exposures that affect all of us to varying degrees.
