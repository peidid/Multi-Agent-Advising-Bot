        "long_desc":  "Earth is an increasingly toxic planet. Fossilfueled industrialization, chemical engineering, and resourceintensive consumerism have generated immense wealth, but they have also left longterm, cumulative legacies of toxic pollution and ecological harm. While these legacies affect everyone, their impacts are by no means evenly distributed. In this course, we will use the tools of anthropology, political ecology, and history to examine experiences of toxic exposure in different parts of the world, including Pittsburgh. Our analyses will ask how inequalities of race, class, gender, and ability shape exposure as well as how cultural differences create divergent understandings of ecology, health, and their interrelationship. We will consider, moreover, how these disparities shape what people know about pollution and whetherhow they demand accountability for it. Cases we explore will range from acute industrial disasters and their aftermath to the harms experienced by otherthanhuman beings to the gradual, often invisible exposures that affect all of us to varying degrees. This course meets the Dietrich Gen Ed Perspectives on Justice and Injustice requirement.",

Describe how patterns of toxic exposure reflect larger structures of inequality along lines of race, class, gender, and ability2. Examine how cultural differences create divergent understandings of ecology, health, and their interrelationship3. Analyze how social inequalities and cultural differences interact to create systematically uneven access to the institutions that define, regulate, and adjudicate toxic harm4. Consider the ethical, political, and practical dimensions of collaborative research involving university personnel and members of exposed communities5. Demonstrate how research on toxics can be designed as a collaborative endeavor that respects the knowledge, concerns, and aspirations of exposed communities.",
