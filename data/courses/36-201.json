        "long_desc":  "This course will introduce students to the basic concepts, logic, and  issues involved in statistical reasoning, as well as basic statistical  methods used to analyze data and evaluate studies.  The major topics  to be covered include methods for exploratory data analysis, an  introduction to research methods, elementary probability, and methods  for statistical inference.  The objectives of this course are to help  students develop a critical approach to the evaluation of study  designs, data and results, and to develop skills in the application of  basic statistical methods in empirical research.  An important feature  of the course will be the use of the computer to facilitate the  understanding of important statistical ideas and for the  implementation of data analysis. In addition to three lectures a week,  students will attend a computer lab once a week. Examples will be  drawn from areas of applications of particular interest to HSS  students. Not open to students who have received credit for  3620770207, 36220, 36225, 36625, or 36247.",
