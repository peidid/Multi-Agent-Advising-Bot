CTFs are offensive security competitions where players hack into competitionprovided services in order to access and read the flag, scoring points for their team.  These competitions generally focus on exploit development, reverse engineering, vulnerability research, cryptosystem analysis, and web platform exploitation.  CTFs have grown into a massive international field, with Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Tencent among others sponsoring and hosting global CTFs.  This course will guide students from a background understanding of computer internals through understanding where and how those can go wrong, culminating in being able to solve challenges found on major easymediumdifficulty competitions.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "grade_option": {"name": "Pass/Fail", "short_name": "P", "never_graded": false, "is_pass_fail": true, "is_audit": false, "id": 4}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
