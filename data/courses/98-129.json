In life, we often feel that we always have to be both effective and efficient. In this course, we offer an alternative approach to programming, where we give ourselves time to stop and smell the roses. Instead of chugging cups and cups of coffee to help us write efficient algorithms, we will instead write wonderfully inefficient algorithms which will allow us to code first, and then have a nice tea break while our algorithm continues to calmly perform its assigned tasks until the heat death of the universe. Welcome to Dysfunctional Programming, where we will take a leisurely stroll to explore pessimal algorithms with some concepts of computational complexity, some theory of computation, some programming techniques, and some math Knowledge of programming will be generally helpful to take this course, but this course will attempt to be fairly beginnerfriendly. To that end, little theoretical computer science knowledge is needed coming into this course, though skill in writing proofs may be useful.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will be able to recognize efficient algorithms from inefficient algorithms at a glance and describe how they work, and students will be able to justify the correctness of their own algorithms with proof Its incredibly important to be able to know, with 100 certainty, that your process works and you can analyze it.", "key_topics": "Complexity and simplexity, recursion and computation theory, recognizing pessimality and optimality, pessimal algorithms with particular applications in sorting, limits of dysfunctional programming.", "prerequisite_knowledge": "None, though having prior programming experience of any kind is encouraged.
