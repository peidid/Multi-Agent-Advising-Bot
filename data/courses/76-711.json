War (about 1973), we will try to define the succession of recent forms (such as minimalism, \"K-mart realism\" or \"magical realism\") and figure out some of the ways in which it represents American society and culture. Writers will range from Raymond Carver and Bobbie Ann Mason to William. Gibson and Alice Walker to Richard Powers and Jhumpa Lahiri.",
