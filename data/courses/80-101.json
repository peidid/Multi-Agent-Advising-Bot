Philosophers address them by producing intricate and often beautiful arguments. In this course, you will assess those arguments and produce your own. You will learn how to have challenging, productive, and respectful discussions across political and moral differences. You will learn to think like a philosopher  to strip an argument presented in prose to its essentials and plainly expose its structure. This course will improve the clarity and rigor of your own thinking and writing. It will put you in a position to make progress on hard questions like those mentioned above.
