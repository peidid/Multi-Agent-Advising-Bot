We begin by discussing the nature of language, especially phonology, semantics, and syntax, and what is known about language acquisition in monolingual environments.  Then we will discuss how a bilingual environment changes the nature of the learning challenge.  We will explore how bilinguals look similar to, and different from, monolinguals in language comprehension, production, and acquisition.  Finally, we will engage with the controversial research literature suggesting that bilinguals may show cognitive advantages over their monolingual peers.  The course involves reading primary source literature, as well as some secondary sources, as well as discussion and reflection on students own experiences with language.",
