        "long_desc":  "This seminar will focus on two themes in philosophy of mathematics. First, we will consider contemporary readings in epistemology on the value of knowledge and the nature of understanding in light of recent work on mathematical understanding and explanation. Second, we will try to understand how mathematics enables its practitioners to come to consensus as to whether a mathematical claim has been established, and was able to do so even before there were formal axiomatic systems to serve as arbiters of truth. To that end, we will consider mathematical debates in the commentaries on Euclid, in early analysis, and in nineteenth century mathematics.",
