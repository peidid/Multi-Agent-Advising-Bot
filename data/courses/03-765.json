The focus will be on addressing how neural circuits change during new skill acquisition and adapt to variations in the environment.  An introduction to experiencedependent changes in neural structure and function, in addition to behavioral learning paradigms, will be provided.  Then we will consider the ways in which specific changes in biological substrates give rise to the emergent properties that drive behavioral adaptation, followed by in depth coverage of deciphering which biological substrates constitute a lasting memory trace. Finally, the concept of agedependent learning will be examined.   Concepts and specific examples will come through reading of primary literature and selected readings from advanced texts.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Correlation", "slug": "correlation", "id": 315}, {"name": "Ageing", "slug": "ageing", "id": 1602}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
