This will require a basic undertsanding of genetics. Course topics will then unify these two areas of biology to examine process by which genomes evolve and how this in turn has lead to the diversity of animal pheonotypes.  This will include discussion of how genomes control embryonic development, how gene regulation has evolved focusing on cis regulatory evolution and noncoding RNA regulatory evolution and the concept of gene regulatory network evolution.  Concepts and specific examples will come through lectures, selected readings from advanced texts and primary literature.",
