This course places great emphasis on constructing and using physical models, with a special focus on computer modeling to solve problems. Throughout the course, both traditional analytics techniques and scientific computing will be used to solve mechanical problems going from planetary systems, springbased systems and nuclear scattering. Topics covered include Newtons Laws, microscopic models of solids, energy, energy quantization, massenergy equivalence, multi particle systems, collisions, angular momentum including quantized angular momentum, kinetic theory of gases and statistical mechanics. Students conduct team research projects that will be presented at a departmental poster session at the end of the semester. This course has a corequisite of 21122.",
