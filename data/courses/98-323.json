Though no educational foundation in urban planning is needed for this course, topics will include basic principles of space, city planning, urban redevelopment, and the social implications of urban construction projects. Divided into two units, this course has two major assignments a course reflection at the midsemester as well as a final project which tasks students with improving aspects of the shows existing environment. Students will come away with a greater understanding of urban planning and development, both in the context of the fictional Pawnee, Indiana where the show is set and the cities we inhabit today.",
