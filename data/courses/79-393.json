This course will explore the history of the Catholic Church, with a particular focus on the church as an evolving European institution. Although we will have to deal with theological arguments at times, abstract theology will not be the focus of the course. Instead, the course will be centered on two main questions. First, how did the Catholic Church manage to persist, for nearly two millennium, as a stable institutional entity within an everchanging European milieu Secondly, to what degree did the Catholic Church influence andor reflect developments within Western European culture",
