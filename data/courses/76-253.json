Information graphics are ubiquitous. They are used by both practitioners and academics across many disciplines to communicate complex ideas, processes, and systems. While millions of decisions are made based on information graphics daily, creating an effective graphic is not simple. Designing information graphics requires careful consideration from multiple perspectives, including visual perception, social psychology, semiotics, and design ethics.   What makes information graphics effective What is required to optimize the design of an information graphic How should information graphics be evaluated Can information graphics be neutral, without bias In this introductory course, we will address these and other questions through a handson project and discussions on various threads of studies around the analysis of information graphics. Assigned readings will complement the projects allowing students to examine information graphics from the perspectives of relevant theories and research findings. Class discussions and critiques are an essential part of this course.",

Class discussions and critiques are an essential part of this course.Learning objectives include Students are able to apply the commonly accepted design process to create information graphics. Students are able to apply the framework of basic visual semiotics to create information graphics. Students are able to apply the basics of visual perception to the design of clear and effective information graphics. Students are able to create information graphics with ethical considerations. Students are able to apply basic researchbased knowledge in social science in the design of information graphics.",
