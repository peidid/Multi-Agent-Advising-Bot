This course will introduce chemistry concepts on an asneeded basis, but it will remain at a simple level. We expect to help the student understand what food is made of, its nutritional value, how it is processed to offer longer shelf life, and how elaboration and preservation procedures may affect critical components. The topics will vary depending on the students motivation in learning about different concepts related to the food industry, from processing to analysis, to packaging, and appearance.

Structure and properties. Eggs; denaturation; coagulation; dehydration phenomenon. 7-Milk and Milk Products. Types of milk.

This course is relevant to educate our students on the value contained, added, or reduced in food through different treatments and processes during and post harvesting and until it reaches the table. We will also address other hidden aspects of food that relate to the way food is presented, packaged, and advertised. Students that took this course commented on the value that introduced in their life being more knowledgeable about the choices they make on the food they eat. Not only they felt many food secrets were revealed but also learned the chemical foundation for some food facts.", "learning_resources": "The recommended textbook is: Essentials of Food Science, 4th Edition, by Vickie Vaclavik and Elizabeth W. Christian, 2014, Springer, ISBN: 978-1-4614-9137-8. Some material will be provided in the course such as notes and links to on-line resources some additional material may need to be procured through the student's own research. Office hours and open-door policy provides flexibility for students to get help when needed. We will use Piazza as the communication platform.", "extra_time_commitment": "Students will invest time in reading the class notes and answering questions of five write ups. Videos assigned may represent more time commitment, such as 45 min to 1 hour and there might be one or two assigned per week. Readings will also be assigned.
