While this project of undoing has taken political and philosophical forms, cultural production has played a central role in retrieving hidden histories and reimagining possible futures.  This course connects theories of decoloniality with works of literature, primarily, as well as some film and visual art that engage in such new imaginaries.  The course will be organized in three units  the African diaspora, the postcolonialglobal south, and critical refugeeborder studies.",
