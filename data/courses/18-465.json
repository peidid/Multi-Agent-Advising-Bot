We will cover basic concepts of probability prerequisite to understanding the material typically taught in a ML course. We will also cover slightly more advanced topics including Markov Chains, hypothesis testing, and maximumlikelihood estimation. The remaining part of the semester will be devoted to introducing machine learning concepts such as supervisedunsupervised learning, model identification, clustering, expectation maximization, etc. Students should be familiar with basic calculus, linear algebra.  Although students in 18465 will share lectures with students in 18665, students in 18465 will receive distinct homework assignments, distinct projects, and distinct exams from the ones given to students in 18665. Specifically, the homework assignments, projects, and exams that are given to the 18665 students will be more challenging than those given to the 18465 students.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Learning foundational material on probability and statistics applying this foundational knowledge in statistical estimationhypothesis testing problems that often arise in engineering applications getting highlevel view of some machine learning concepts.", "key_topics": "- Basic Concepts of probability: Bayes Law, independence, conditional probability; random variables, PDF, CDF, joint distributions; order statistics, mean, variance, moments; inequalities\n- Advanced Topics: Markov Chains and ergodicity; hypothesis testing; MMSE estimation, ML estimation\n- Introduction to selected topics in machine learning: supervised and unsupervised learning methods; model identification, expectation maximization, clustering", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Calculus (integrate, differentiate, Taylor-series expansions).
