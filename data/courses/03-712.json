It is intended for graduates and advanced undergraduates with either biological or computational backgrounds who are interested in developing computer models and simulations of biological systems. The course will emphasize practical algorithms and algorithm design methods drawn from various disciplines of computer science and applied mathematics that are useful in biological applications. The general topics covered will be models for optimization problems, simulation and sampling, and parameter tuning. Course work will include problems sets with significant programming components and independent or group final projects.",
