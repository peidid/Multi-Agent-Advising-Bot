Where many collegiate poetry courses focus on historical poetics, this course aims to introduce students to the newest, most exciting poetry that shapes our current cultural landscapes.   The democratic, accessible nature of short written work makes it a universal vehicle for expressing a broad spectrum of experiences and touching on myriad identities. The course will have a particular focus on marginalized poets, as well as intersectionality, by drawing on works from a diversity of ethnicities, classes, sexualities, genders, nationalities, and so on. Thus, students will learn how to engage with the creative work of many and varied people and pay respect to their stories, a vital skill in all walks of life.   Through weekly readings 34 poems, articles, podcasts, or videos per week, students will gain increased fluency in interpretation of contemporary poetry. They will learn to analyze works and then incorporate observed techniques into their own poems. They will write a poem each week, ultimately developing a cohesive body of creative work.
