The experimental modules reinforce concepts from 42101 Introduction to Biomedical Engineering and expose students to four areas of biomedical engineering biomedical signal and image processing, biomaterials, biomechanics, and cellular and molecular biotechnology.  Several crosscutting modules are included as well.  The course includes weekly lectures to complement the experimental component.       Premed students should register for 03206.   Priority for enrollment will be given to students who have declared the Additional Major in Biomedical Engineering.",
