This course will focus primarily on the TV show itself and will let students draw their own conclusions on whether or not its popularity is warranted. However, a few meetings will be devoted to the huge fandom My Little Pony has spawned, as well as how Hasbro interacts with its fans. We will watch, discuss, and analyze episodes, as well as bring in outside articles, YouTube videos, and interviews in an effort to understand My Little Pony Friendship is Magic.
