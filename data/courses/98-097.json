This is a technical course that teaches the tools and workflow involved in Zbrush. Students will learn the basic understanding of how to use Zbrush.   Students will work on different projects each week.  No prior experience is required.   We will use Discord as our primary means of communication.  There will be critics of the weekly assignments.",
