Students will gain a fundamental understanding of how these systems are designed and work, as well as the role of data in mitigating or enhancing biases. The course is multidisciplinary in nature and brings together social scientists, engineers, data scientists, and designers to tackle the grand challenge of dealing with issues of bias and fairness in HumanAI collaborative systems, ranging from the data that is used to train them, to their human creators that are responsible for deciding how they work and get used. Students will investigate policy, technology and societal elements aimed at reducing and mitigating the impact of AI biases that can negatively impact society, especially its vulnerable members.",

Faculty teams attend to topics ranging from social and economic inequality to racism to artificial intelligence to food production through a variety of disciplinary lenses, exposing students to the methods and forms of argumentation in respective disciplines. These courses will include field trips, guest speakers and community building activities in the college and in collaboration with other colleges at CMU. Students build relationships with their faculty team and classmates through collaborative inquiry on socially salient topics and practice communication skills. Intimate faculty-student relationships build as we cap ratios at one faculty member to every sixteen students.",
