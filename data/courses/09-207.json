It is also suitable for fulfilling the requirement for two general chemistry labs for admission to programs in the health professions. The experimental work emphasizes the techniques of quantitative chemical analysis. Included are projects dealing with a variety of instrumental and wet chemical techniques. A mixture of individual and partner experiments are conducted during the semester. In addition to laboratory techniques, safety, and written communication skills are emphasized.",

To develop powers of observation and thus learn to record and maintain a laboratory notebook To communicate findingsresults to a general audience in written format To further develop problem solvingcritical thinking skills so that they are able to understand how to use the techniques learnt on realworld samples To learn how to use basic reference manuals in chemical literature",

This takes the form of virtual labs that closely mimic the actual experiment. In doing so, they are able to come into the lab prepared to perform the analysis. o Students technique skills and knowledge of mathematical concepts required for the course (in terms of precision and accuracy) are assessed through submission of data and summary sheets and accuracy scores. The data and summary sheets allow us to determine whether or not they understand the math required to analyze their data. The accuracy scores provide a measure of how good their technique is. Students are often provided analytical unknowns whose concentrations are well known. o Depth of understanding of the technique and its application are assessed through written lab reports and exams. Lab reports and exams are given throughout the semester covering the key topics: Titrations, Spectroscopy (\u0026 Chromatography) and Gravimetric Analysis.",
                                                    "relevance":  "This course is targeted to non-chemistry majors who have previously taken Modern Chemistry I and II. Students will thus apply the knowledge that they have learnt in these courses in a lab setting. They will gain both the knowledge and experience of working in an analytical chemistry laboratory. The course itself teaches them how to identify and use laboratory equipment, prepare solutions, perform titrations, use modern day analytical instruments such as a UV-Vis and AA spectrophotometer and HPLC. Students will also learn how to work safely in a laboratory by first learning how to identify hazards associated with chemicals and then learning how to dispose of these chemicals in a safe manner.",

The syllabus, lecture notes, recitation activities and exam material are all provided on Canvas. Canvas is updated daily/weekly. - The textbook \"Exploring Chemical Analysis\" 6th edition by Daniel C Harris is referenced throughout the course. Purchase of the textbook is optional. Copies of the newest edition and older editions are on reserve in the Sorrells library in Wean Hall. - Students are given an \u0027in house\u0027 lab manual that provides information regarding safety, how to write the notebook, how to write reports, introductory background information on the experiments, as well as procedural information for the experiments. The manual also references and suggests problems from the Harris textbook. - Students are provided with an outline of lecture notes at the start of each lecture. - Students are provided with online videos that cover how to use each of the glassware/ equipment that they will be using throughout the semester - Students are provided with video tutorials demonstrating how to solve suggested problems given in the lab manual - Students are encouraged to use Piazza (online discussion forum) to ask questions. Teaching assistants, course instructors, and graders are all given access to Piazza and questions are often answered within minutes. - Each instructor, teaching assistants provide office hours on a as needed basis.",

We recognize that students work at different paces and that there may be emergencies that arise so we have been flexible in accommodating students outside their regularly scheduled time."
