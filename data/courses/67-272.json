Better understand the objectoriented programming paradigm and how to use OOP concepts to create more coherent and stablesoftware4. Understanding why and how to do software testing5. Learning how to use source code control to manage project development6. Knowing and applying principles of usercentered design to the development of software7. Utilizing all of the above to build webbased applications.",
