It uses a variety of computational techniques based around the use of MATLAB or a similar system. Topics to be covered include Integration techniques and numerical integration. Ordinary differential equations techniques for solving ODEs and numerical methods. Modeling with ODEs e.g., infection, population models. Linear algebra matrices, complex numbers, eigenvalues, eigenvectors. Systems of ordinary differential equations if time allows stability of differential systems. Probability discrete and continuum probability, conditional probability and independence, limit theorems, important distributions, probabilistic models.  Three 50 minute lectures, two 50 minute recitations",
