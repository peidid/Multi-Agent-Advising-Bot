We will identify yeast gene products that undergo changes in expression or subcellular localization after simple environmental perturbations or drug treatments.  Students will be trained in basic molecular biological methods, including recombinant DNA manipulation, and basics of functional genomic resources.    Enrollment is limited to firstyear students in MCS.  Special permission required.",
