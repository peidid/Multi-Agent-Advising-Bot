Over time, these ideas have become embedded in the ways we conduct psychological research. In this course, we will investigate some of the assumptions inherent in various subareas of psychology, including social psychology, developmental psychology, and research methods. Students in this seminar course will learn how to evaluate and critique psychological theories and research from different philosophical, historical, and cultural perspectives.",
