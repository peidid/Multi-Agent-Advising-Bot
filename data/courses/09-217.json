The properties of organic molecules are discussed from the structural perspective considering geometry, polarity and intermolecular forces. The course gives an overview of the chemical reactions used to create reactive substrates to produce new chemical entities and teaches strategies to synthesize compounds from multifunctional substrates. Overall, the course prepares students to think globally about a problem and be able to device different approaches to solve it. Often, students comment that they like the solving puzzle nature of this course.",

The highest five scores out of the seven homework assignments (100 points, 20 points each) are added. Total points: 500 (=100%). The final grade (A, B, etc.) is straightforward: 90+% =A; 80.0-89.9 = B; 70.0-79.9 = C; 60.0-69.9 = D; below the D score the student receives R and needs to retake the course.\nGiven that students are able to drop the equivalent to two exams, there are no make-up exams or no curving.

IClicker is used to stimulate active participation in lecture; some extra credit is awarded for student participation. Office hours and open door policy allows for flexibility to access help; students can also ask questions through Piazza with an average response time of about 30 min; emailed questions are also answered. Supplementary Instruction and Walk-In consultation is made available to the 09217 students through other CMU resources. The Office of Disability Resources also offers exam proctoring as well as additional help to students with different disabilities, including time management.",

In this course is fundamental that students keep consistency with the time dedicated to the course materials. Falling back may entail an important time investment to catch up. Practice is the key to succeed and taking advantage of the practice offered in the course is one advice that students should pay close attention to."
