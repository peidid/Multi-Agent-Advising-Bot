We will cover popular primitives such as pseudorandom functions, encryption, signatures, zeroknowledge proofs, multiparty computation, and Blockchains. In addition, we will cover the necessary numbertheoretic background. We will cover formal definitions of security, as well as constructions based on well established assumptions like factoring. Please see the course webpage for a detailed list of topics.",
