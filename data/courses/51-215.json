Students leaving this class will have gained knowledge of developing a moving picture from start to finish. Students will learn storyboard, plan, production, and postproduction video. Equally importantly students will start to develop their own visual aesthetics in the creation of 1 short moving pictures. The primary software for this course is Adobe Photoshop, with which students will explore construction, combination, manipulation, input, and output of video as a means of narrative creation. This Micro course will run between 56 weeks. The instructor will fly into Doha for a short period of facetoface classes, centered around a Saturday. Enrolled students should expect two 90minute facetoface classes during the week before or after this Saturday date, as well as four 90minute evening 6730 pm video classes over the duration of the Micro course typically two before the campus visit, and two after, although instructors can change this. Specific dates will be confirmed in the syllabus closer to fall semester.",
