A vision for the future of artificial intelligence was laid out by Turing Award winner and Moza Bint Nasser University Professor at CMU, Raj Reddy in his 1988 Presidential address to the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. It is time to provide an accounting of the progress that has been made in the field, over the last three decades, toward the challenge goals. While some tasks such as the worldchampion chess machine were accomplished in short order, many others, such as selfreplicating systems, require more focus and breakthroughs for completion. A new set of challenges for the current decade is also proposed, spanning the health, wealth, and wisdom spheres. The above  plus commentary from half a dozen AI thought leaders  forms the basis of an article in the 2021 Spring Issue of AI Magazine.",
