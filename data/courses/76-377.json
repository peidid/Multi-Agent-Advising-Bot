This course will consider a selection of key Shakespeare films alongside critical readings centered on questions of authorship, adaptation, technology, and performance. As we watch, read, write, and converse together, we will work toward a broader understanding of what Shakespearean drama means in a 21st century context and how film has helped to shape Shakespeares unparalleled cultural influence.",
