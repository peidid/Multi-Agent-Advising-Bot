        "long_desc":  "Telling a story through film requires creating a world that captures the imagination and fancy of moviegoers. Whether a movie is in its preliminary or final stages of development, the setting of the film is essential to the overall storyline. Historical, fantastical or grounded in reality, each style and sense of place has its own impact on the storyline. We will look at the history of architecture in films, the role architecture plays in fantasy, futuristic, dystopian, and hybrid world building. We will also examine famous architecture, its destruction, and films that reach outside of what we understand as place and time. A captivating film is rooted in a strong storyline. A gripping storyline is nothing without the context in which its placed. The context, the built environment, and the architecture will be the focus of our exploration of film from the 20th century to the present day.",
