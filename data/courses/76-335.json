It will cover the movement from modernism, through midcentury realism and postmodernism, to the contemporary. We will look at scholarly definitions of those modes, as well as some of the cultural context that has informed American literature. Some of the authors will include modernists like Stein and Faulkner midcentury writers and postmodernists like Ellison, McCarthy, and Pynchon and contemporary writers like Diaz, Lahiri, and Franzen.",
