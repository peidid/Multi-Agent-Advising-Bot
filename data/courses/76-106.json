Within the course, we will discuss texts and evidence from multiple perspectives. We will examine how literary and cultural scholars write about texts defined broadly, how they make claims, provide reasoning, and use textual support to argue for particular ways of seeing cultural objects. Throughout the semester, students will draw upon prior strategies and develop new ones for close reading and for critical analysis in order to produce their own thesisdriven arguments about why texts matter. We will consider and write about the extent to which these reading strategies are relevant for other kinds of reading and analysis by comparing texts from a variety of different disciplinary contexts. Because the course emphasizes authentic stakes and purposes for communicating with academic audiences, students will regularly share their work with their peers in oral and written forms within an interactive and collaborative classroom environment.",

Taking two out of these three minis is one of the course options that students can choose to fulfill their First-Year Writing requirement. The other option is to take a full-semester course, normally 76-101. If you like the idea of a fresh start in the middle of the semester, taking two mini courses might be a good option for you. The minis offer students the opportunity to focus upon strategies for particular types of communication situations and target genres. By taking two minis, you will gain exposure to more than one kind of writing: arts \u0026 humanities-based (76-106), technical (76-107), and professional (76-108). You will also learn ways of adapting to new and different communication situations. Some students report a more dynamic structure and pace driven by the break at mid-semester.",
