During the seminar, students will be presented with opportunities and experiences designed to help them frame how the MCS curriculum aspires to shape their evolving identities in the areas of scholar, person, professional and citizen, while also engendering a sense of excitement about science and scientific inquiry.  The seminar will offer information and strategies that are employed both by successful students and by successful scientists in optimizing their approach to work and life, with a key focus on areas such as cognitive learning skills, research, teamwork, goal setting, time management, innovation, community engagement, ethics, resources and assessment.  Additionally, the seminar will introduce firstyear students to the learning outcomes and requirements associated with the MCS core curriculum, with a particular emphasis on the selfdirected ENGAGE courses and the role of the eportfolio system in documenting and framing student growth and development. Students who are enrolled in FADS are encouraged to enroll in a recitation section taught in the Mellon Institute.",
