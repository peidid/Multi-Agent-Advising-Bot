The firm grounding in the fundamentals is aimed at providing students the  flexibility to build and analyze models from diverse applications as well as preparing the interested student for advanced work in these areas.  The course will cover core concepts such as probability spaces, random variables, random vectors, multivariate densities, distributions, expectations, sampling and simulation independence, conditioning, conditional distributions and expectations  limit theorems such as the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem as well as additional topics such as large deviations, random walks and Markov chains, as time permits.
