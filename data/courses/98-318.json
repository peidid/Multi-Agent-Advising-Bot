Of particular importance to the field of Arabic language is the craft of writing its words and letters, which on itself is a vast field with plentiful of contributions from calligraphers throughout the past 1400 years. In this course, we will take a very brief look at the world of Arabic calligraphy, with a strong emphasis on the practical aspect of it. We will focus mainly on the two most frequently used fonts in modern Arabic media, Reqa and Naskh, and learn how to apply these fonts to some common words and phrases.",
