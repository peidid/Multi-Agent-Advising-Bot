Each class is designed to cover an emerging research area within HCI, from designing largescale peer learning systems to designing games around audience agency. All sections will help students 1 build a more comprehensive understanding of an area of study within HCI, 2 work closely with faculty and peers to create miniprojects or team assignments that help students master the course material, 3 explore evidencebased research methods and techniques in HCI.    Sections will vary in topic and often change from semester to semester. Because of this, students can take multiple sections, as they are individual classes. Undergraduate sections are listed as 499 and graduate sections are listed as 899.
