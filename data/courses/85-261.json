This course will focus on learning about and understanding the range of behaviors which fall within the province of abnormal psychology. Its approach will be descriptive, empirical, theoretical, and conceptual. Students will examine definitions of abnormality in a historical and contemporary context, explore issues relevant to diagnosis and patient care, be introduced to various psychological diagnostic categories, and develop an appreciation of the range of empiricallysupported treatments for these disorders.",
