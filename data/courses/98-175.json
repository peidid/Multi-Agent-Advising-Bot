The course will be divided into three parts. The first part covers the history of computational biology and the current developments in this field. The second part covers genomics and computational problems. Here, we will examine the different tools and databases utilized to understand computational biology. The tools will include, but not restricted to, simple statistics mathematics computer science knowledge python and molecular genomics. The third and last part covers genome sequence and reallife examples. Here, we will be modeling population dynamics, cell pathways, and neuron behaviors in organisms.",
