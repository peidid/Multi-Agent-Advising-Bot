        "long_desc":  "This is a first course for those considering majoring or minoring in Computational Finance. The theme of this course is pricing derivative securities by replication. The simplest case of this idea, static hedging, is used to discuss net present value of a nonrandom cash flow, internal rate of return, and putcall option parity. Pricing by replication is then considered in a oneperiod random model. Riskneutral probability measures, the Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing, and an introduction to expected utility maximization and meanvariance analysis are presented in this model.  Finally, replication is studied in a multiperiod binomial model. Within this model, the replicating strategies for European and American options are determined.  Three 50 minute lectures",
