        "long_desc":  "Why do states fight wars Why do some wars last for years while others end in days How is it possible that powerful states may lose wars to underresourced nonstate actors Why are some peace settlements stable, while other ceasefires crumble precipitously  Why do some states get challenged by subnational groups By surveying the most recent quantitative research in political science, this course explores various security challenges that contemporary states face at the international level and in the intrastate political environment. We will focus in depth on the bargaining explanations for war, democraticregime similaritycapitalist peace, deterrence, interdependence through trade, cooperation through international organizations, and civil wars. The goal of this course is to demonstrate how theoretical and empirical approaches in social sciences can be used to answer questions about war and peace. Students will acquire training in graphical literacy as well.",
