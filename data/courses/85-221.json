Relate the facts, theories and methods of developmental psychology to everyday problems, social issues and real world concerns across a variety of cultural contexts and generations i.e., possible applications. Describe evolutionary and historical changes in childhood and the science of child development. Demonstrate curiosity about child development in general, and how it applies to your own development.",

To consider how answers to each of the above questions depend on one\u0027s PERSPECTIVE and one\u0027s sources and\nmethods of data collection, all of which depend on theoretical stance, culture, and historical period.\n\n\n4) Then what?
