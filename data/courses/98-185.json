Students will learn the basics of tilting, turning, and speeding up a yoyo, doing simple tricks like tossing and catching, and combining basic tricks to create more complicated tricks, combos and routines.  Each week, students will learn about a certain type of trick through demonstration and then practice together to improve their skills, and instructors will help as needed. Each weeks lesson will build on previously learned skills, culminating in a midterm and final performance, where students will design their own routines individually or in a team with the help of instructors, and then perform them in front of the class.
