Gameplay is performance. The skills developed when creating any timebound media transfer well to games but must be seen through a different lens  the lens of the player. To do so, we first examine and dissect both RPG story and game design using pencil and paper examples seeking an understanding of both game systems as well as narrative best practices. In class we focus our examination on the most popular existing intellectual property The Lord of the Rings. Students who desire admittance to this class should be at least somewhat familiar with that world to succeed in the class. Each student works on a fourperson team to create an original RPG campaignstyle adventure for an already existing story world. The final product is a portfolioquality set of dramatic scenes, epic tabletop encounters, and character sketches. This is not an RPG design course.  Any level of writing experience is welcome, BUT experience playing RPGs  either tabletop or video game  is a must. Experience as a GM for an RPG is a big plus, and applicants who possess such experience should be sure to let the instructor know in advance.",
