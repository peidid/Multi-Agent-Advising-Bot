A good working knowledge of calculus is required. Topics include combinatorial analysis, conditional probability, generating functions, sampling distributions, law of large numbers, and the central limit theorem. Undergraduate students studying Computer Science, or considering graduate work in Statistics or Operations Research, must receive permission from their advisor and from the instructor.
