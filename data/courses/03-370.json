Essentially, the focus of the course will be the basics of the biotechnology entrepreneurial process and a deep background on biotechnology enabled products. The objective is to provide the background for managementlevel personnel to make decisions based on knowledge of contemporary biotechnologies and the legal and regulatory environment. Because it is impossible to be comprehensive with regard to all applications, the goal is to provide students with sufficient familiarity with current biotechnology and with a framework for assessing biorelated business questions that they may encounter in the future through a combination of independent research, assessment of opportunities and pitfalls, and historical comparisons.  NOTE This course CANNOT be counted towards the advanced biology electives for any major or minor in Biological Sciences.",
