        "long_desc":  "Censorship Banned books Book burnings Could it happen here Over the last century some of the most important films and books have book banned, censored, protested and withdrawn from high schools and in rare cases, college courses or public libraries. But artists dont like to be silenced, and many of them have found ways to tell their stories, regardless of the consequences. In this course we will read a handful of books that have all been challenged by parents, school boards, andor library patrons. This year is a special SciFiFantasy version of the course We will read texts including Shirley Jacksons The Lottery and Other Stories, J.D. Madeleine LEngle A Wrinkle in Time, J.K Rowling, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Salman Rushdies Satanic Verses, Margaret Atwoods The Handmaidens Tale, Octavia Butlers Kindred, and Chuck Palahniuks, Fight Club. We will also celebrate the American Library Associations banned book week, which is September 25th to October 1.",
