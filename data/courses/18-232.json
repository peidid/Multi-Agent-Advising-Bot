One such option is conducting undergraduate research with a faculty member. Students do not need to officially register for undergraduate research unless they want it listed on their official transcripts. An ECE student who is involved in a research project and is interested in registering this undergraduate research for course credit on the official transcript may request to be enrolled in this course. To do this, the student should first complete the online undergraduate research form available on the ECE undergraduate student page. Once the form has been submitted and approved by the faculty member the student is conducting the research with, the ECE Undergraduate Office will add the course to the students schedule. Typical credit is granted as one hour of research per week is equal to one unit of credit.",
