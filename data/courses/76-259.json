Every week, we will screen a film of the most important genres and we will understand these films in relation to multiple contexts the system of production, popular, critical, and scholarly reception, and social and political events. We will be concerned with understanding how the studio system produced and marketed these works, and how that system changed significantly as result of various events postWW II. By focusing on individual studios for example, MGM and Warner Bros. as test cases, the class will also examine how particular companies produced films of a certain type in terms of such parameters as genre, theme, player, class address, andor style. Readings will deal with the history of Hollywood, the various films, stars andor filmmakers considered, as well theoreticalcritical issues such as authorship, reception, and high vs. low culture. Students will learn important skills for film history, including reception study, archival research, and contextual analysis. Grades will be based on three papers that require different kinds of historical research, a midterm, and a final.",
