Emphasis is placed on the utilization of reaction mechanisms for understanding the outcome of chemical transformations, and the employment of a wide variety of functional groups and reaction types in the synthesis of organic molecules. Also included in the course will be special topics selected from the following polymers and advanced materials, biomolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids, and drug design. 3 hrs. lec., 1 hr. rec.",

In this part of the series, the focus is on the reactivity of molecules that show different stability and properties than the ones presented in the first course of this series. Such molecules are aromatic compounds and dienes. The synthesis of a variety of compounds derived from carbonyl containing molecules will be discussed. Overall, the course prepares students to think globally about a problem and teach them to device different approaches to solve it. Often, students comment that Organic Chemistry I is like solving a puzzle, Organic Chemistry II offers additional pieces to widen the variety of products that can be created through synthesis and teaches additional concepts about reactivity and complementary knowledge on spectroscopy.",

The sequence of topics may not be as shown. 1- Conjugated Unsaturated Systems, carbocation stability, electrophilic additions, Diels-Alder reactions; 2- Aromaticity, aromatic compounds, spectroscopic properties of aromatic compounds; 3- Reactions of aromatic compounds, electrophilic and nucleophilic aromatic substitutions, reduction of aromatic compounds; 4- Aldehydes and Ketones, nucleophilic addition, their synthesis, addition of alcohols, amines, ylides, and cianides; oxidation of aldehydes; 5- Carboxylic acids, synthesis of derivatives: ester, amides, anhydrides, acyl chlorides; carboxylic acids as nucleophiles. 5- Enols and Enolates, tautomerism; synthesis and reactions. 6- Conjugate addition of carbonyl compounds and condensation; Claisen condensation; aldol reactions; cyclizations. 7- Amines, basicity; synthesis, reactivity; derivatives. 8- Introduction to Carbohydrates, Lipids and Proteins.",

The one-hour exams and the final exam will be graded on 100-point scales. To calculate your grade we will add all three one-hour exams (300 points) and three times the Final score (300 points); the two lowest scores will be dropped (400 points left). Your highest five scores for the homework (100 points, 20 points each) will be added. Total points: 500 (=100%). The final grade (A, B, etc.) will be straightforward: 90+ % = A; 80.0-89.9 % = B; 70.0-79.9 % = C; 60.0-69.9 % = D; all below this score will receive an R. Grades will not be curved.

We will use Organic Chemistry by Solomons and Fryhle as a reference textbook but any other organic chemistry textbook would work well, a public domain version of the 10th edition of the textbook is available in Canvas. The following on-line resource: https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/VirtTxtJml/intro1.htm will be very useful. Office hours with a TA, the Piazza discussion forum, and an open door policy by the instructor will provide the student with additional help",

Solving problems is the best way to succeed in this course; having a weekly routine for practicing is the most efficient way to assimilate the material.
