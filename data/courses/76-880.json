While much of early scholarship on feminist rhetorics dedicated itself to recovering the voices of women in history, since then scholars have expanded their focus to consider how gender interacts with the concerns of protest, law, health, medicine, war, politics, technology, migration, and the list goes on. Throughout this course, we will consider how feminist rhetorical scholars have 1 critiqued the discipline of rhetoric 2 developed new methods useful for analyzing gender in a variety of contexts and 3 expanded the scenes of rhetorical study. Readings will include but are not limited to canonical investigations into early feminist rhetorics Karlyn Kohrs Campbell, Cheryl Glenn, Jacqueline Jones Royster, influential theories on contemporary topics Karma Chvez, Robin Jensen, Raka Shome, and popular accounts of feminism by current writers and activists Beyonc, Roxane Gay, Malala Yousafzai. Students will conduct their own research on a topic related to feminist rhetoric that also aligns with their professional and academic goals. Graduate students interested in research will benefit from this courses focus on theory and methodology and gain an understanding of the scholarly trajectory of feminist rhetoric. Undergraduates students both majors and nonmajors will have the opportunity to examine how gender intersects with communication and writing contexts in their everyday public and professional lives.
