We will look at early fiction, like Washington Irvings Rip Van Winkle and mid1800s classics like Hawthornes Scarlet Letter, up to twentiethcentury works like The Great Gatsby and perhaps some contemporary novels.   Through the term, we will ask how the fiction represents the special character of American experience. Alongside readings, you will write several short papers and present some of your research to the class.",
