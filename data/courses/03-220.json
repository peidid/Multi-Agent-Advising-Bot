Molecular mechanisms of gene expression and gene regulation are analyzed. Recombinant DNA and its applications in genetic analysis, biotechnology, forensics, agriculture, medicine, and the pharmaceutical industry are presented. Special topics in human genetics are considered, such as the genetics of cancer. Principles and methods for the study of developmental genetics, population genetics and complex traits are also introduced.",

Recognize and quantify linkage relationships. 3. Derive basic parameters of linkage and selection from population data. 4. Explain fundamental mechanistic features of mutation, DNA repair, and recombination, and apply these principles analytically. 5. Recognize and explain mechanisms of DNA transfer in bacteria and phage. 6. Interpret basic features of gene regulation and its effects on genetic interaction. 7. Interpret features of development and tumorigenesis in view of principles of gene regulation and gene interaction.8. Explain current approaches for analysis of gene function based on bioinformatic and functional genomic methods, and apply this knowledge to make predictions and design experimental workflows.",
