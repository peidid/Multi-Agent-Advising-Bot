        "long_desc":  "The Emergency Medical Technician provides students with a basic knowledge of Emergency Medicine, and enables students to take the National Registry EMT Certification exam and become certified at the state and national level. This course is crossenrolled through the Community College of Allegheny County CCAC and will require registration with CCAC on the first day of class. This will require a fee, which has yet to be determined. Due to state laws and classroom hours requirements, all lectures are mandatory with very few exceptions. This class will meet on around 2 Saturdays, which will be announced on the first day of class. This class is also offered in two parts. The first part 69194 is offered during mini2 and the second part 69195 is offered during the full spring semester. You must attend both parts in order to be eligible to take the National Registry EMT Certification exam. Please email infocmuems.org with any questions you might have.",
