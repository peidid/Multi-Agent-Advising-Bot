This course serves as an introduction to current concepts and experimental approaches in this rapidly advancing field. Topics in the course include genomics, differential gene expression, cell signaling, cell movements, tissue morphogenesis, stem cells, human development, and regeneration. The course examines the genes and signaling pathways that control development and the role that misregulation of these pathways plays in human disease.",

What are the fundamental questions that development poses 2 To understand the experimental strategies that biologists use to study development. This includes both an appreciation of basic scientific method the formulation and experimental testing of hypotheses and an understanding of specific experimental strategies commonly used by biologists to study development. 3 To gain an understanding of the current state of scientific knowledge concerning the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms that underlie development. This is the factbased part of the course. Our focus will not be on memorizing everything that has been learned about development in all model organisms but on a thorough understanding of major concepts. We will also highlight what is NOT understood about this process i.e., important gaps in our current knowledge. 4 To understand the close relationship between developmental processes and human healthmedical science. 5 To be able to contribute productively to the resolution of important societalethical issues associated with human reproduction and development.",
