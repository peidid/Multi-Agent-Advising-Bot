Some episodes also withheld much deeper messages in terms of the psychological, philosophical and theological ideas and thoughts, and we will be analyzing them in depth primarily through engaging class discussions. This course will help develop critically evaluative skills in a way which students can relate to through nostalgic remembrance of their childhood.",
