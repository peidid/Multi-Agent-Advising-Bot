Among the issues we will want to tackle are a the demise of rhetoric and its subsequent contemporary revival, with the role played by modernity and postmodernity in this process b the relation between contemporary rhetorical theory and its tradition c rhetoric as a theory of verbal action. The foci of the course will be major figures in the field, as well as more controversial representatives of contemporary rhetorical theory.
