Students screen selected films, learning first the basics of film theory, cinemas working structures and the function of music. Ultimately, they analyze, in the form of a written essay, the function and value of the music in a particular film and the cultural impact such music has had on society. The work of the course involves attendance at screening and active participation in analytical discussions. Students are expected to present one report consisting of a critical review of the reading assigned. A final examination dealing with some film theory, music, and cultural politics will conclude the course.",
