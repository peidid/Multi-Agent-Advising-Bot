On the theoretical side, we consider how archives are constructed, imagined, used, and critiqued. What is an archive What can it do and not do How does technology shape archival work On the practical side, we learn how to enter archives as researchers, including how to safely and efficiently work with primary source material. Class activities may include visiting archivesmuseums, guest speakers from the libraries, and working on research grantfellowship applications.",
