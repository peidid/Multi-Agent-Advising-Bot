Knowledge gained from this course will be both conceptual and analytical.  Students will periodically write extensive research reports on select topics and give oral presentations on a select few, while critically analyzing primary literature.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Molecular Biology", "slug": "molecular-biology", "id": 153}, {"name": "Proteomics", "slug": "proteomics", "id": 154}, {"name": "Primary", "slug": "primary", "id": 1246}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "1 Apply key cutting edge experimental techniques to design of experiments that study the molecular basis of cellular function, including western blots, 2D proteomic gels, PCR, Sanger sequencing, CRISPRCas9, genetic screens, sequencing by synthesis, genomic reconstruction, and in situ labeling of DNARNAprotein. 2 Analyze scientific articles by critically reading the methology and data to understand the uses and limitations of the above techniques. 3 Design intervention strategies using all of the above expertise toward problem solving in applicationbased research for translating basic science into treatment of human diseases.", "key_topics": "The course will cover:\n1) the molecular mechanisms and regulation of key cell biology processes including cell signaling, central dogma, cell cycle and DNA replication, intracellular trafficking, and energetics.\n2) the significance of individual molecules and cellular pathways in relationship to the following: cell survival, cell division, cell growth, tissue growth, and organismal development", "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": "3-4 cumulative midterm exams, a final exam, weekly homework, weekly quizzes, required in-class activities, group presentations of research papers, individual presentations of research topics", "relevance": "Students will learn core facts about how biological systems work and prepare for possible future course work, including courses in automation of the biological research techniques taught.", "learning_resources": "Students will be required to read selected chapters of \"Molecular Biology of the Cell\" by Alberts.
