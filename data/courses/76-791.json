Students will be introduced to the basic concepts and vocabulary, as well as the practical issues of visual communication design through a series of handson projects in various rhetorical situations. Assigned readings will complement the projects in exploring document design from historical, theoretical, and technological perspectives. Class discussions and critiquing are an essential part of this course. Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator will be taught in class, and used to create the assigned projects.",
