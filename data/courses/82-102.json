Using a proficiencyoriented approach, students will expand contextually appropriate interpersonal communication skills in both written and spoken French, continue to develop reading and listening skills through the use of various media, review previously learned and practice new grammar and vocabulary, and gain a further understanding of French and francophone cultures through class activities. Regular homework, quizzes, tests, presentations, and class participation are mandatory four inclass hours per week. The elementary level is also designed to help students learn to reflect and draw upon strategies used by good language learners in their second language study. A student with prior experience in French must take the placement exam.",
