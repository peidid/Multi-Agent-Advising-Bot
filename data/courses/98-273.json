Topics including the origin of mermaids, mermaids in mythology, gender and sexuality in mermaids, mermaids in the media, and the existence of mermaids will be covered in this StuCo. We will use stories such as Hans Christian Andersens The Little Mermaid, movies such as Disneys The Little Mermaid and Peter Pan, and even cultural icons like Aquaman to get a better understanding of the mermaid phenomenon and how it affects us.",
