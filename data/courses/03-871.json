The physical properties of biological macromolecules and the methods used to analyze their structure and function are discussed in indepth lectures. Topics covered include protein architecture and folding nucleic acid structures and energetics structure determination by Xray crystallography and NMR optical spectroscopy with emphasis on absorption and fluorescence, NMR spectroscopic methods other methods to characterize proteins and proteinligand interactions, such as mass spectrometry, calorimetry, singlemolecule manipulation and measurements, and surface plasmon resonance. Sufficient detail is given to allow the student to critically evaluate the current literature.",
