The students will get a chance to learn the basis of color representation in art and how it affects people. This can be applied when preparing future presentations in any of their courses based on the topics and their color representations. The second part will focus on application of the color theories and texture representations through fashion illustrations. Students will learn to sketch fashion illustrations and apply different techniques such as printing, crafting, painting and coloring and color theories in fashion. While this course includes many art concepts, students will be graded on their efforts and not art abilities.",
