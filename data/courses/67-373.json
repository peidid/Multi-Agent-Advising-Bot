        "key_topics": "To help build skills in all areas of 'people, process, and technology' you will work in a engagement with a community partner. Each project team will propose, define, design and implement a working information system or application with the project client. Teams should act as consultants working 'with' and not 'for' their project clients. Successful teams never assume ownership of a client's project. Rather, they work hard to build sustainable, maintainable solutions and partner capacity. You will gather your client's articulated requirements and you will seek to understand and address their unspoken requirements.\nThroughout the semester you will work to deliver and integrate a working solution to your client's satisfaction into their organization. It will be accompanied by documentation, training and support materials. Because of our short time frame and absolute deadline, you must employ careful and skillful project management throughout. You must deliver your solution on time; extensions beyond the semester are not possible.",
