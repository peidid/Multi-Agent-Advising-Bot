Software quality is then defined from different perspectives product quality, quality in use and process quality through the use of specific quality models. The course systematically explores different quality characteristics and the techniques most appropriate to verify them. Specific topics include test case design, test automation, code reviews, testing ML applications, technical debt, cost of software quality, planning for quality, and defect classifications.",
