Have you ever wanted to increase your public speaking skills but didn't know how?  Well, this StuCo is for you!  Mock Trial - the StuCo will take a look at what it means to be a successful mocker.  The class will begin by giving an overview of what mock trial entails and what is required by both attorneys and witnesses on a team.  It will end with students presenting a full case, competing with other students in the class.  In the beginning, class will be mainly lecture-based, but as the semester progresses, the class will be more presentation- and teamwork-based.  By the end, students will be able to present their own Mock Trial case and, in doing so, increase their own public speaking and presentation skills.", "student_sets": [], "offering_tags": [], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Public Speaking", "slug": "public-speaking", "id": 1213}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "grade_option": {"name": "Pass/Fail", "short_name": "P", "never_graded": false, "is_pass_fail": true, "is_audit": false, "id": 4}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
