Have you ever wanted to increase your public speaking skills but didn\u0027t know how?  Well, this StuCo is for you!  Mock Trial - the StuCo will take a look at what it means to be a successful mocker.  The class will begin by giving an overview of what mock trial entails and what is required by both attorneys and witnesses on a team.  It will end with students presenting a full case, competing with other students in the class.  In the beginning, class will be mainly lecture-based, but as the semester progresses, the class will be more presentation- and teamwork-based.  By the end, students will be able to present their own Mock Trial case and, in doing so, increase their own public speaking and presentation skills.",
