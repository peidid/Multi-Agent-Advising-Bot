Students will expand explicit knowledge of sociocultural influences on Chinese language use, and be able to apply the knowledge to conduct culturally appropriate spoken and written communication across various social domains and genres. Topics to be covered in this class will be closely related to current social issues in China, such as population, youth culture, love  marriage and housing. Students will also develop a repertoire of strategies and resources to assist their learning so that they will gradually become autonomous learners who are able to conduct independent learning of the Chinese language, culture, history, and society. Classroom discussion and essay writing will be the major forms of work throughout the semester. Research projects on Chinese culture and society are also a requirement so that students will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural background of the language.",
