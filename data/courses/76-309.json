The premise of this course is that great stories raise essential questions about the human experience. We will study how and why narratives raise these questions by focusing on a few fundamental texts in the Western tradition, as well as on philosophical responses to them. We will seek to understand the power of these narratives in framing our moral imagination about key issues, such as justice,  empathy, and truthfulness. ",
