Students who complete this course will have a good understanding of designing for user experience. The course emphasizes three themes and contexts for digital design and humancomputer interaction HCI designing for the web, designing for mobile use, and multimodal interactive design. Students will also be exposed to a variety of usability testing methods with stateoftheart tools such as Morae and Tobii eyetracker.",

Another such discipline is interaction design, which maintains a broad mind about what types of products it creates and how technology is a part of those products, all the while firmly holding human-centeredness as a core value. These skills and knowledge are invaluable to Information Systems students as they move into the real world and start building information systems for real world applications.",
