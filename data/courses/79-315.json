The purpose of this course is to introduce students to social and political aspects of water, using indepth case studies that draw on a variety of perspectives. Examples of regional water projects well study include traditional tank irrigation in South India international negotiations along the Nile River and the U.S. Government in negotiation with native activists and fisheries on the Columbia River. In addition to regional variety, readings will explore a variety of themes, for example, water and gender water and armed conflict and water and private companies versus public management.  By the end of this course, students should be able to articulate their own answers to these questions How have global organizations and participants characterized, enacted, and addressed problems of water supply and delivery for those who need it most How do particular regions reflect global trends in water resource development, and how might these diverge from global trends How have social and environmental studies in the literature of development come to understand the problem of water  One set of readings is assigned each week. Students should be prepared to discuss each weeks readings in a thoughtful way during class meeting time.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "In The Water", "slug": "in-the-water", "id": 969}, {"name": "Drinks", "slug": "drinks", "id": 1562}, {"name": "Human Resources", "slug": "human-resources", "id": 1846}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "sustainability/environment", "id": 16, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will obtain an understanding of how decisions to manage public and private water supplies were reached.", "key_topics": "The course will cover the history of water politics and social problems concerning water access, delivery, and supply.", "prerequisite_knowledge": "no prior knowledge required", "assessment_structure": "There will be weekly readings, weekly reading quizzes, two short papers, a mid-semester take-home exam, and one short student presentation (5 minutes).", "relevance": "Students will understand the history and current situation for global water politics, engineering, and social efforts to make water available to more people and projects.", "learning_resources": "Students will be required to read two short books about the history of water engineering projects.", "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
