        "long_desc":  "The study of economic history provides important perspective on current economic institutions and policies. A failure to understand the historical evolution of economic institutions or the variety of past economic experience is perhaps the worst shortcoming of many economists. The study of economic history provides an opportunity to test currently fashionable theories against data different from those used in their construction. In fact, this is a course in applied economics. The theories developed in the intermediate courses will be applied to episodes from the past in ways that increase understanding both of the specific historical episodes considered and the economic theories employed.  Lecture, 3 hours. Minimum grade of C required in all economics prerequisite courses.",
