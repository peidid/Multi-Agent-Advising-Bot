In addition, we will briefly explore several fields of translation studies, such as health care, business or literature, that require specialized terminology and expertise in the subject. All theory taught in class will be accompanied by handson translation projects that will give students the opportunity to try out their knowledge firsthand and evaluate the usefulness of different approaches on a personal basis.",
