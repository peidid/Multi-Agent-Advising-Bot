During your career as a designer, you will be expected to produce written documents to supplement and accompany your design processes and solutions.  In this course, you will learn the conventions associated with the types of writing that designers most often have to produce on the job, such as proposals, memos, and reports. Additionally, you will prepare a job packet including a resume, a cover letter, and a portfolio that you can use as you begin your job search. You will also refine your ability to talk about your projects to both expert and nonexpert audiences. Ultimately, this course aims to prepare you for the professional communications situations that you will encounter in your design career.",
