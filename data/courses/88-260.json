The course begins by examining economic theories of the firm, and explores some of the canonical questions, such as why are there firms, how the separation of ownership and control of a firm shapes decision making, what determines the boundary between organizations and markets e.g., makeorbuy decisions, what types of firms are most innovative, and how new technologies affect organizational structure.  A second set of issues concerns how various organizational forms motivate, or fail to motivate, employees.  The central concepts will be fleshed out by examining business firms, as well as notforprofit enterprises, political parties, and government agencies.",
