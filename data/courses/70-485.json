Competitive teams will be assigned to one of these three clients and asked to deliver a formal presentation of your findings, strategy and recommendations to the client (who will have in-person representatives who will provide feedback and evaluate the presentations).\n¿ Background, data and other materials provided prior to the case (short overview)\n¿ Your team should do a research-based assessment and recommendations (PPT)\n¿ Client will listen to presentations and select \"winner\"\n2. Product and Brand Management Project (35%): You will also be asked to formulate a team to select and conduct your own brand assessment and recommendations. You should:\n¿ Teams of 2-6 members use research-based approach (survey, focus group(s), audit, etc.)\n¿ Preferably organization or product you have access to (might want to invite them to your final presentation vs. mega brand)\n¿ Proposal (1-2 page write up that outlines your approach, research, etc.)\n¿ Periodic project updates (report-outs in class)\n¿ Final session, formal presentation of results and recommendations\nSome of you may elect to complete these assessments on behalf of other groups and/or clients. If possible, please plan to include their input throughout the project and invite them to the final presentation. There are four assignments (check in or update points):\n¿ Project proposal (1-2 page summary of your research problem and plan)\n¿ Tool (questionnaire, survey, online form, etc. that you plan to use to conduct your brand assessment)\n¿ Progress report (an update on where you are, preliminary recommendations, etc.)\n¿ Final presentation/report\n\n3.

Placing an ad, pitching a press release to a trade journal editor, sponsoring a booth at a trade show¿those actions showed that a business owner or marketing manager was doing the right stuff. And the more you did, the better. But no longer. Today\u0027s pressure-packed marketplace is very different. There\u0027s more competition, more informed consumers and customers and more at stake.\n\nTo give companies a competitive edge, marketers created branding and have started to figure out how, when and where to use assorted techniques that take relatively minor and sometimes insignificant differences between products, services or ideas and magnify those differences in such a way that someone else is willing to select and pay more for the branded item over the non-branded one.\n\nTo complicate matters even further, you used to be able to establish national and global brands relatively systematically through big media buys in traditional channels, like TV, radio and newspapers. Now, the media and marketing channels have become so fragmented that building a brand has become perhaps more of an \"art\" than a \"science.\"\n\nSince the best way to learn something is to actually do it, Product and Brand Management is a project class. Through real-world client cases (from organizations who will listen to your recommendations and presentations, we will hold three \"Agency Shootouts.\" These are mini-case competitions based off of information provided in class. Also, either by yourself or with a handful of teammates, you will be asked to conduct your own brand assessment (primary and secondary marketing research) and come up with a recommendation and plan for improving a real product, service or company brand (preferably one that you have a client connection to and is not necessarily an established, national brand that most everyone has already heard of).
