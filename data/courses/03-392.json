It is designed with the recommendations of the American Society for Microbiology for a student laboratory course in mind in order to introduce the student to a broad spectrum of techniques in microbiology.  You will learn the skills needed to perform experiments that help to differentiate various types of microbes, examine antimicrobial and antibiotic sensitivity and resistance, and begin to explore microbial diversity. Finally, you will develop an understanding of the theory behind the techniques you use and will be given the opportunity to further develop your skills in the process of experimental design.  THIS COURSE WILL BE OFFERED EVERY OTHER SPRING, BEGINNING IN THE SPRING 2017 NOT offered spring 2016.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Microbiology", "slug": "microbiology", "id": 165}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
