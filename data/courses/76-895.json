How might we apply their methods to literary study This course will look at different modes of interviewing. You will also conduct various kinds of interviews yourselves. Thus the course will be a mix between a criticism course and a workshop. Through the semester you will be responsible for conducting and editing one longform interview with a person about art, literature, or another field. In addition, you will develop a project conducting multiple interviews on a topic.
