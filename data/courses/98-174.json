Each lecture will focus on a different topic such as data structures, dynamic programming, and system design questions. Students will learn how to apply and modify classic algorithms and data structures from classes like 15122 and 15210 to solve problems that frequently show up in the coding challenges during the job interviews. We hope students come out of this course better prepared for the interview season, both technically and in terms of presenting themselves.",
