        "long_desc":  "In this course we read fiction of the U.S. in the 20th Century in the context of two movement or tendencies, realism and modernism. The idea behind the course is that realism isnt replaced by modernism, but rather persists along side and is influenced by it. We will ask to what extent modernism typical of such writers as Joyce and Woolf on the other side of the Atlantic actually developed on this side. Likely authors will include James, Chopin, Dreiser, Wharton, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Faulkner, Wright, Ellison, Updike, Roth, and Morrison.",
