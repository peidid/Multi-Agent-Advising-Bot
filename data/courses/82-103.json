Materials are webbased, with extensive use of Internet technologies for listening, reading, and communication. During regular semesters, this course is offered in a hybrid mode requiring one 80minute class per week in addition to weekly 20minute individual meetings with the instructor or a peer speaking  assistant. There is a materials fee for taking this course which is paid by credit card on first login to the course website. A student with prior experience in French must take the placement exam.",
