They will appreciate what they see today in a broader historical context. This context will give them a sharper understanding of the present, and of what is expected in the near future.4 Analyze and apply perspectives of economists, historians, sociologists, anthropologists, political scientists, and ordinary people to explore the causes and consequences of politicaleconomic hardship and social unrest. 5 Evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of different political philosophies and the policy approaches they have pursued, including the effects of these different approaches on income inequality, economic security, and the effects of different policies on quality of life from cradle to grave.", "key_topics": "On markets: Under certain conditions, markets can guarantee \"efficiency\" (to be defined). However, markets may generate inequality, especially by class, race and gender. Furthermore, social and economic changes may reduce wellbeing and lead to social unrest. You will model structural changes and inequalities in the economy, appreciate the social disruption that these problems can cause, and consider public policies that may soften the effects of markets on society. (Note: In addition to structural change and inequality generated by markets, there is a third major justification for public policy, which is market failure. Market failure is covered in depth in standard public economics courses. See me if you are interested in learning more.)\n\nOn democracy: Under certain conditions, democracy delivers outcomes that a majority of voters prefer, and can even pull political candidates toward the political center. However, these conditions are difficult to satisfy. Moreover, when markets deliver widespread dissatisfaction, this may affect the strength of democracy.\n\nOn public policy: The social disruptions and inequalities caused by markets can be softened by policy. This, in turn, may potentially reduce social unrest and increase political support for democracy and markets. You will learn about several examples and choose one of interest to you to write about and present at the end of the semester.\n\nSome important analytical concepts: property rights, productivity growth, constrained optimization and demand curves, income and price elasticities of demand, market saturation, substitutability versus complementarity between humans and machines as inputs to production, Edgeworth box and the First and Second Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics, Polanyi's concept of \"embeddedness\" and the \"double movement\".
