Grids emerged to address contentstructure needs linked to print production, leaving opportunities to fully explore how they can better help stakeholders in interactive environments. As we explore this space, specific skillsets will include   developing a better understanding of visual composition through the grid,   using the vocabulary of communication and information design in critique,   manipulating typographic variables to create readable documents,   learning approaches to invention using image, text,  typography,   creating simple to complex grid structures,   developing skills in Illustrator, Photoshop, and Adobe XD,   adapting simple prototypes to HTMLCSS through basic Bootstrap.",
