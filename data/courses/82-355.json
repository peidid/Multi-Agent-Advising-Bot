Undoubtedly, films are a rich source of meaningful cultural information that can provide the audience with an understanding of a countrys culture history, politics, social problems, etc. through their discussion and analysis. Movies not only represent reality, but they do it from a particular position. The images produced in films are charged with political interests that reproduce or challenge established beliefs and views. Films offer different representations of reality as well as different ways of relating to it Achugar, 2008. We will view and analyze a selected group of films portraying four main issues in Hispanic history and society memory and oblivion, immigration and exile, marginalized identities throughout history, and the Hispanic world in globalization. An understanding of the sociopolitical context that these films aim to portray through indepth reading, analysis, discussion, and investigation will provide a thorough understanding of the complexities of various historic events, and opportunities and challenges faced by the Hispanic world. Throughout the semester, we will practice the four language skills listening, speaking, reading, and writing as we continue to build on vocabulary and review grammar points based on the films viewed, the texts read, and the topics discussed.",
