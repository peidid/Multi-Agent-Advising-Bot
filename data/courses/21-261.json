One of the goals of this course is to prepare students for upper level courses on differential equations, mathematical analysis and applied mathematics. Students will be required to write rigorous arguments. Topics to be covered Ordinary differential equations first and second order equations, applications, Laplace transform, systems of linear ordinary differential equations systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, equilibria and stability, applications.  Corequisites  21268 or 21269 or 21259 and 21241 or 21242. Three 50 minute lectures, one 50 minute recitation",
