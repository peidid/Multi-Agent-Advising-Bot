        "long_desc":  "Competitive programming CP is commonly referred to as a mind sport like chess, puzzles, etc. that requires participants to give solutions to specific problems under certain constraints and allotted time. It is useful because it not only helps players improve their problem solving ability and coding skills but also opens many career opportunities as big companies such as Google, Microsoft, etc. pay close attention to the CP community and recruit top players. Amazing as it is, however, getting started with the field can be difficult. Although Carnegie Mellon University currently offers two courses to introduce students to CP  15195 and 15295, These courses concentrate intensively on the most common algorithms and introducing theoretical concepts but overlook more practical aspects  useful tricks, good implementation style, etc. Therefore, we propose a StuCo course to fill in this gap.",

We will achieve this by revisiting some course content and extending the discussion towards applications in programming competitions. There are some overlapping topics with other courses but in this course, we will discuss in a more competition-oriented lens.",
