The course focuses on cultural history instead of the more traditional emphasis on presidents, wars, and memorizing facts or timelines. The major theme of the course is the changing meaning of freedom over three centuries. Required readings include several short books and historical documents, which will be paired with class lectures to provide students with context needed to think about and understand Americas cultural history. Assignments will include three short essays and a final research project on a form of popular culture of the students choosing, developed over the course of the semester through three short blog posts.",
