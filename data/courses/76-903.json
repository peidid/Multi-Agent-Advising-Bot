While the fall practicum focuses on nutsandbolts methods for classroom management and instruction, the spring practicum aims toward scaffolding students toward making grounded choices for their own 76101 courses that they will teach the following fall. At the end of the semester, all participants present their preliminary syllabus plans to the group, as well as a reading list and rationale for the choices made.",
