        "long_desc":  "In this course we will investigate how the apparently simple concept of circularity both in stillness and in motion has accreted meaning. Starting with the circle as presented in early geometry, we will encompass circularity in ancient and Renaissance astronomy as well as classical physics. We will also discuss appearances of the circle in literature, philosophy, and art since our study will reveal connections such as how Aristotles views on nature influenced Ptolemy and an understanding of our place in relation to the world, including central imagery in the poetry of Donne. As we demonstrate proofs and analyze texts, circularity will emerge not only as a device through which intellectual revolutions have occurred, but also as an object that has itself been transformed over the centuries.",
