It aims to help students compose clear, concise technical writings and oral  presentations for multilevel audiences.  Assignments include technical  definitions, descriptions, instructions, process explanations, abstracts,  memos, and research reports.  Assignments may incorporate recent computer  science research at Carnegie Mellon, projects in related technical courses,  and professional case studies.  Sophomores will likely find the course more useful if they have either had an internship or facultysupervised research, including SURG projects prior to enrollment.",
