        "long_desc":  "There has been a flurry of recent work on a variety of modal logics designed for reasoning about knowledge, belief, and evidence, in both static and dynamic contexts. What is the relationship between knowledge and belief What is the role of evidence and justification How do we react to new information, update our beliefs, and reason conditionally These are old questions which modern logical frameworks promise to shed new light on. In this seminar we will read and analyze contemporary papers on these topics, both to gain an understanding of the current stateoftheart, and to critically assess the extent to which these formal frameworks are genuinely enhancing our understanding of the underlying phenomena of interest.",
