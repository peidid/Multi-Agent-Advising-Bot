In particular, we will study what causality is, how it is related to and different from correlation, the relationship between causality and regression, the benefit of using causal knowledge, the classical ways to find causal relations, when it is possible to achieve so from purely observational data, and machine learning methods for discovering causal structure.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Mathematical History", "slug": "mathematical-history", "id": 253}, {"name": "Probability", "slug": "probability", "id": 305}, {"name": "Correlation", "slug": "correlation", "id": 315}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
