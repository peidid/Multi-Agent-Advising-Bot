Students will also continue to develop their abilities to express their ideas both in speaking and in writing, as well as their listening skills in Modern Standard Arabic. There is no prerequisite for this course but it is expected that your language proficiency in the Arabic language is good. This is a content course in the Arabic language and not an Arabic language course.",
