They are the backbone of any webbased application, and they are built to do most of the heavy computing tasks that allows these applications stay dynamic and responsive. With the advent of Node.js, serverside development has become more advanced and approachable thanks to the scalability and modular design of the language. In this course we will learn how to use this advanced language to create a variety of creative server applications, such as a live chat system, GPS tracking, serving web content, and more.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "grade_option": {"name": "Pass/Fail", "short_name": "P", "never_graded": false, "is_pass_fail": true, "is_audit": false, "id": 4}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
