The experimental work emphasizes the techniques of quantitative chemical analysis. Included are projects dealing with a variety of instrumental and wet chemical techniques. The course is projectoriented with the experiments becoming more complex, requiring greater student input into the experimental design as the semester progresses. A mixture of individual and team experiments are conducted during the semester. In addition to techniques, safety, written and oral communication skills, and effective teamwork are emphasized.  2 hrs. lec., 6 hrs. lab.",

You will gain a strong foundation in the more traditional wet chemical methods of analysis such as titration and gravimetric analysis and modern instrumental methods of analysis including ultravioletvisible spectrophotometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, microwave digestion and highpressure liquid and gas chromatography. These are important tools for analysis and you will have a good working knowledge of those techniques.2. You will begin your Carnegie Mellon training in experimental design. Not only should you be able to use a technique in the particular situation that we have prescribed, but also you want to understand its utility in a broader context. This in the end is what will prove much more useful to you in the future. In what situations might the method prove useful What are the constraints and in general how would the analysis be performed 3. You will also gain experience in written and oral technical communication. 4. You will receive training that satisfies the university requirement for certification in laboratory safety and chemical waste handling.",

This first laboratory class for chemists and students in allied majors focuses on introducing traditional and modern instrumental methods of quantitative analysis. In keeping with the CMU strategic goals the class assists in developing deep disciplinary knowledge, communication and skills associated with strong teamwork. Through the analysis of \"real world\" samples and the development of an independent team project students develop skills instrumental in science research.",
