This course introduces students with a background in computer science and a research interest in artificial intelligence fields to the structure of natural language, from sound to society. It covers phonetics the physical aspects of speech, phonology the soundstructure of language, morphology the structure of words, morphosyntax the use of word and phrase structure to encode meaning, syntactic formalisms using finite sets of production rules to characterize infinite configurations of structure, discourse analysis and pragmatics language in discourse and communicative context, and sociolinguistics language in social context and social meaning. Evaluation is based on seven homework assignments, a midterm examination, and a final examination.",
