Students will write their own magazine articles, working with both their own autobiography and subjects they engage as field researchers. We will also be considering online, oral narratives, as a way to expand the concept of what a magazine is, and students will have the opportunity to create narratives for oral presentation. In this course, you should expect to develop your ability to create a good narrative, to gain experience in the field as interviewer and observer of the world, to become a better editor of your own work and the work of others, and to learn about aspects of culture from a wide variety of contemporary magazine writers. The class is run as a discussion with emphasis on student participation.",
