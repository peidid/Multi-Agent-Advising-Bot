It will not be counted as a psychology seminar.  Without memory, people would barely be able to function we could not be able to communication because we would not be able to remember meanings or words, nor what anyone said to us we could have no friends because everyone would be a stranger no memory of meeting anyone we could have no sense of self because we could not remember anything about ourselves either we could not predict anything about the future because we would have no recollections of the past we would not know how to get around, because we would have no knowledge of the environment. This course will discuss issues related to memory at all levels the sensory registers, i.e., how we perceive things working or shortterm memory longterm memory or our knowledge base.  The course is intended for students who have already completed Introduction to Cognitive Psychology 85210 or 85213 and are comfortable with courses that expect an appreciation of computational ideas and mechanistic explanations.  We will discuss the differences between proceduralskill knowledge, and declarativefact knowledge. Formal computational models to explain phenomena and also make predictions about results of experiments will also be covered.  Topics include working memory and its role in cognition and encoding and retrieval memory illusions, malleability of memory,  feeling and knowing, implicit memory, and amnesia.  Please contact Dr. Reder at redercmu.edu regarding enrollment.",
