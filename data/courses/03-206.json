The experimental modules reinforce concepts from 42101 Introduction to Biomedical Engineering and expose students to four areas of biomedical engineering biomedical signal and image processing, biomaterials, biomechanics, and cellular and molecular biotechnology. Several crosscutting modules are included as well. The course includes weekly lectures to complement the experimental component. Priority for enrollment will be given to students who have declared the Additional Major in Biomedical Engineering. Notes This course number is reserved for students who are CIT majors and registered with the HPP program. If you require a biology lab for prehealth admissions requirements, register for 42203 and Dr. Sang Chalacheva will work with students once the semester begins to register for 03206 instead of 42203.  Priority for enrollment will be given to students who have declared the Additional Major in Biomedical Engineering.",
