It is estimated that billions of people worldwide identify as athletes. Often, we perceive these individuals as highperforming humans, yet few truly understand the aspect of their mental processes. In this course, me and you will go on a journey to explore the inner workings of athletes minds, seeking to understand their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. The course structure is designed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of athlete psychology. Approximately 70 of our time will be dedicated to instructional content, providing insights into athletes behaviors across various sportsbe it teambased or individual. The remaining 30 will be a discussion and an interaction with athletes from the specific sports, allowing them to share their personal experiences and insights. Join me as we go deep into sport psychology, relating physical and mental resilience.",
