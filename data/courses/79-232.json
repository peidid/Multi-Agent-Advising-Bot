This course will look at the history of the Arabian Peninsula from a fresh  perspective, examining humanenvironmental interactions over a long  stretch of time. In contrast to the way that Arabian history is typically  taught in academia, this course will take the preIslamic period of  Arabian history aljahiliyya as seriously as the postIslamic period,  and will focus on continuities between the two periods as much as  discontinuities. What is more, while conventional histories of the Arabian  Peninsula focus on political and religious affairs, this course will try  to understand Arabian history on a deeper level by focusing on the  lifeways of the Arabian people, including pastoralism, oasis bustan  garden agriculture, fishing and pearling, and shifting patterns of  longdistance trade. What is more this course will draw heavily from  material from other disciplines, especially medical sciences, to better  understand patterns of change over time. Finally, this course will examine  to what degree these older patterns of humanlandscape interactions are  still valid for the Arabian Peninsula today, which has undergone a  transformation almost unparalleled in world history due to the discovery  natural gas and oil.",
