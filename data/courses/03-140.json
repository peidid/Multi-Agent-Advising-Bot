At the completion of this course, students will be able to 1 Discuss the diversity of life and the biological processes that link them together. 2 Identify constraints imposed on living organisms by the physical environment, both aquatic and terrestrial, and describe how these function as agents of change through the process of natural selection. 3 Examine plant diversity and explain the processes of photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, Big and adaptation to the environment. 4 Examine animal diversity and explain how structure and function regulate bioenergetic, physiological, and behavioral processes and adaptation to the environment. 5 Explain how characteristics expressed at the level of the individual organisms ultimately determine the collective dynamics of the population. 6 Describe the experimental strategies that ecologists use to study the natural world. This includes both explaining the basic scientific method the formulation and experimental testing of hypotheses and an explaining the application of experimental techniques. 7 Analyze primary sources by interpreting figures and tables, describing their core findings, identifying limitations, proposing future lines of investigation, and discussing the findings in a broader social context. 8 Discuss the role that humans play in affecting characteristics of the environment.", "key_topics": "(1) Overview: Major ideas in Ecology and Environmental Science.
