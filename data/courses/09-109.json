Then use a kitchen as your laboratory to test hypotheses and delve into molecular cooking  you may just get to eat your lab results.  For this course high school background in chemistry would help but nothing more advanced is required.  Concepts will be discussed on a need to know basis. Students with stronger chemistry backgrounds should enroll in 09209. 3 hrs. lec. and lab",
