Extracting biological understanding from both large and small data sets now requires the use and design of novel algorithms, developed in the field of computational biology. This gateway course is intended as a first exposure to computational biology for firstyear undergraduates in the School of Computer Science, although it is open to other computationally minded  6students who are interested in exploring the field. Students will learn fundamental algorithmic and machine learning techniques that are used in modern biological investigations, including algorithms to process string, graph, and image data. They will use these techniques to answer questions such as How do we reconstruct the sequence of a genome, How do we infer evolutionary relationships among many species, and How can we predict each genes biological role on biological data. Previous exposure to molecular biology is not required, as the instructors will provide introductory materials as needed. After completion of the course, students will be well equipped to tackle advanced computational challenges in biology.",

This gateway course is intended as a first exposure to computational biology for firstyear undergraduates in the School of Computer Science, although it is open to other quantitatively and computationally capable students who are interested in exploring the field. By completing this course, students will encounter a handful of fundamental algorithmic approaches deriving straight from very widely cited primary literature, much of which has been published in recent years. The course also introduces basic concepts in statistics, mathematics, and machine learning necessary to understand these approaches. Many of the ideas central to modern computational biology have resulted in widely used software that is applied to analyze often very large biological datasets an important feature of the course is that students will be exposed to this software in the context of compelling biological problems.",

Although taking an introductory biology course concurrently cannot hurt, it is not required for this course, which is first and foremost a computational course.\n\nBecause of the course\u0027s heavily quantitative and computational nature, we suggest the following prerequisite courses. We also suggest that students consider taking 15-122 (Principles of Imperative Computation) concurrently to guarantee strength in programming.\n\n- 02-201 (Programming for Scientists) or 15-112 (Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science)\n- 15-151 (Mathematical Foundations for Computer Science) or 21-127 (Concepts of Mathematics)",

Homework assignments will comprise two parts.\n- Automatically graded programming assignments (20% of grade) will ask you to implement many of the algorithms forming the great ideas for this course. Programming assignments must be completed on your own (unless noted otherwise) and turned in to the autograder by a given deadline.\n- Theory questions (10% of grade) will be provided before each lecture to encourage you to review the material and arrive to class prepared.\n\n2. Examinations (40% of grade). The midterms and final exam will test your knowledge of the material from the class. The midterms will be held in class and the final will be held during the university\u0027s scheduled time.\n- Midterm 1 (10%)\n- Midterm 2 (10%)\n- Final (20%)\nThe midterms will not be cumulative: midterm 2 will cover material encountered after midterm 1. That having been said, later material in the class builds upon the earlier material, so it is important to know the earlier material.\nThe final will be comprehensive, i.e., it will cover all the material from the class.\n\n3. Project (20%). We want this course to empower you to find your own great ideas in computational biology. Accordingly, you will complete a project analyzing a biological data set. We will provide more details about the project as the course progresses.\nThe final week of the course will feature in-class presentations. You will be graded on this presentation as well as a write-up describing your work.\n\n4. Attendance and participation (10%). Attendance will be taken, and we will have occasional in-class exercises that serve to reinforce the concepts we have covered. These exercises will not be graded, but participation will be expected in order to receive a complete grade for that day.\nYou are allowed 3 \"dropped\" attendance grades without penalty. These can be used for any purpose.",
