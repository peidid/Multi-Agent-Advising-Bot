Dwarf Fortress is the creation of one developer, Tarn Adams, who has declared it his life\u0027s work.  It has been under development since 2002, and is approximately one-third complete as of the current version.  Though its following is still relatively small, Dwarf Fortress has seen wider exposure via numerous news features, as well as being exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",
