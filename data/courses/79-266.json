We will discuss the struggle for power within the Party in the 1920s, Stalins triumph over his opponents, the wrenching processes of collectivization and industrialization, and the Great Terror. The course will explore the Soviet role in World War II, the shattering losses, and the death of Stalin in 1953. This course meets the Dietrich Gen Ed Humanities requirement.

When the Soviet Union broke up in the 1990s, the archives opened up to researchers. The course uses new archival findings to discuss the changes in historiography, or the study of history itself, as historians have incorporated new evidence into our understanding of events. Students will learn to ask questions about revolutionary transitions and what policies are possible within what constraints. We use a historical approach to analyze what spurs revolutionary change and why state policies evolve within a specific set of contexts constrained by economics, social formations, and ideology. Students will learn to analyze secondary and primary sources as well as literary texts that engage large questions of social movements, development, and change over time.
