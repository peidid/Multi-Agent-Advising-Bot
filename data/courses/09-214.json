The course focuses on thermodynamics, transport and reaction rates and their application to chemical and biological systems. Emphasis is given to attaining a good fundamental understanding of entropy and free energy. This is more a concepts than skills building course. Topics include applications of thermodynamics to chemical and biochemical equilibria, electrochemistry, solutions, and chemical kinetics. 3 hrs. lec.",
