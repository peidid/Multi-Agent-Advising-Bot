The course seeks to explore both how and why science has become the dominant way of knowing about the natural world, as well as how scientific activity intersects with the history of religion, war, commerce, and the state. The course also introduces students to the history of science as a standalone discipline, and in particular to the similarities and differences with other objects of historical inquiry art, politics, etc..
