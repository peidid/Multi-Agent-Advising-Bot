        "long_desc":  "There are many cults active today, despite the very public demise of many wellknown ones. Some cult members believe that mediation has healing abilities, while others believe in cannibalism and mass murder. Many have been active for decades, some as old as a century, with a few others that sprung up only in the last few years. What these groups share is a charismatic leader and the belief that they are chosen above all others. In this course, we will discuss how cults come to be through defining persuasion and identifying the factors that influence it and how cult leaders utilize them. We will also introduce some famous cults and their leaders.",
