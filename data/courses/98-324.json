This course will combine independent study and interactive inclass activities in order to create clinical settings that will call for your use of Spanish. Our objective is to have students be able to comfortably communicate with Spanishspeaking patients in a culturally sensitive manner. In addition to basic language development, students will learn Hispanic cultural values and beliefs that could affect their clinical decisionmaking and the way they interact with patients. No prerequisites are necessary. If you are a prehealth student, a Spanishspeaker, or someone interested in gaining an incredible life skill, this is the StuCo for you",
