        "long_desc":  "Charisma, also known as personal magnetism, is one of the most coveted personality traits seen in human society. There are many benefits to be derived from this trait for example, charismatic people often have an easier time building healthy social lives, impressing interviewers, and leading teams effectively. Unfortunately, it is commonly believed that charisma is something a person is either born with or not. This damaging belief has discouraged many uncharismatic individuals from striving to develop this trait  a feat that is entirely possible if the trait is properly understood. In this class, students will study the major components of charisma and practice exercises designed to help them fully master these components.",
