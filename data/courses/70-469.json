It requires putting together the virtuous pipeline of using the data to derive descriptive and diagnostic inferences, building explainable predictive models and incorporating them in prescriptive decision making. This course charts this process endtoend by describing and integrating common tools for modeling uncertainty, machine learning, and optimization in the context of common applications from finance, marketing and operations. The coursework is based on datadriven cases that will have students analyzing data from real business applications to derive their own insights, predictions and decisions and communicating them effectively. The course will prepare students for careers in consulting and any form of business data analysis in any functional area. This course may use thirdparty course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.   If so, the thirdparty course material will be secured and provided by the Tepper School to students enrolled in the course, and students enrolled in the course will be required to pay to the University the associated additional course materials fee for the thirdparty course material provided.   The amount of the course materials fee is dependent on the Universitys cost of the particular materials provided, and typically ranges from 13 to 75.",

The homework should be done in teams of two (or three) students that are formed at the beginning of the semester and retained throughout: The homework is to work on a case study that involves the end-to-end analysis of a real data set. Each homework submission will involve submitting a short update report (PDF file of 3-5 pages) and a code workbook in R or Excel - To aid your analysis, simple scripts or workbooks will be provided as a template for each such assignment. In your report, I would like a careful description of the main findings - plan to formulate your charts and tables so that the most interesting ones can be repurposed for your final presentation and report.",

The course will introduce and build models in Excel and R, a free programming language used ubiquitously in modern analytics ecosystems. Prior programming experience is not required. Class sessions will introduce new ideas every week that will be typically be followed up by walking through a prototype model in R or Excel.\n\nSoftware: We will use R and Excel to develop prototype models for this class. We will use R studio for model development in R. All in-class labs and the homework related to the class project will involve starting from scripts provided, understanding them, interpreting the results and modifying them to extend and deepen the analysis.",
