        "long_desc":  "From business operations to international affairs, leadership concerns the use of power or influence to coordinate a group towards common purpose. However, leadership also requires the acceptance of responsibilities not shared with the other groups members. Given their distinctive role and responsibilities, leaders must be prepared to face a unique host of moral problems and dilemmas. In this course, we will pursue the question of what makes a morally good leader, as opposed to a merely effective one. To that end, we will critically examine various competing theories of leadership while considering the moral challenges that arise when power, selfinterest, justice, and the collective good collide.",
