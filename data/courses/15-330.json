On completing the curriculum, students will be prepared to continue developing their interests in security or privacy through graduate study; to be informed participants in public and other processes that shape how organizations and society develop to meet new challenges related to computer security or privacy; and to take jobs in security or privacy that will provide further training in applicable areas.",
