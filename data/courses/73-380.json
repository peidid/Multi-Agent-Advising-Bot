This course studies many such situations, including economic examples such as entry deterrence, takeover bids, and strikes and political examples such as the arms race and nuclear strategy, U.S. foreign policy, and elections.  The courses goal is to draw out the fundamental principles underlying strategic decisionmaking.",
