Having originated in the United Kingdom and United States in the early 20th century, it still draws mostly from American and European experiences and philosophies, and focuses disproportionally on those countries and their concerns. This shapes the questions we ask and how we answer them. The result are blindspots and limitations that become ever more apparent as we try to make sense of an increasingly globalized world in which nonWestern societies play a more salient role. In this course, students will rethink international politics from the vantage points of GlobalSouth countries, and learn about how their historical experiences and philosophical traditions inform perspectives on contemporary international relations, shaping both national strategies and regional and global politics. We will discuss the role of culture, identity, and ideology in foreign policy, and explore dynamics of inequality, status, hierarchy, and authority in international politics. Students will read and discuss materials from scholars and policymakers hailing from Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Politics", "slug": "politics", "id": 1191}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "The overarching goal of this course is to help students become more attuned to different perspectives on international relations.
