By media we mean print and embodied performances that probably did the most to shape publics and public opinion in this period the theatre and print media such as periodicals, newspapers, poetry, biography, and other prose forms that are often considered ephemeral, but which permeated the reading experiences of the literate and even filtered into the embodied experience of the many British people who did not read. We will begin with materials read and performed at midcentury, moving through the Georgian period into the age of revolution and its aftermath in the early 19th century. As we consider the periods media and its effects, we will read theoretical and critical work in the fields of book history and performance studies in order to understand texts and their historical functions in their material and embodied forms.",
