Topics will include the nature of proof and causal inference, manipulation of independent variables, measurement of dependent variables, questionnaire design, experimental ,and quasiexperimental, design and ethical issues involved in doing research. Survey, observational and experimental techniques as applied in both field and laboratory settings will be covered. Students will be expected to criticize completed research. They are also expected to design measures and complete their own original studies. During the course of the semester students will also be expected to design and carry out an original research project as well.",
