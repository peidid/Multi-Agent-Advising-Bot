We will study specific human rights issues tackled by filmmakers in Latin America, such as cultural rights, gender and sexuality rights, economic rights, environmental issues, and war and state terror. Furthermore, we will discuss specific film schools and movements that developed to address human rights and social justice issues in diverse Latin American contexts. Finally, we will look at how Latin American films work the international human rights film festival circuit, and the ethical and practical implications of filming local human rights issues for international audiences. All coursework for this section in English.",

Using evidence and considering multiple perspectives, students will be able to articulate and discuss some of the major human rights issues, with corresponding key events and actors, in Latin American history and present times. 2. Students will be able to examine these issues as not isolated incidents endemic to a particular culture but as part of interconnected, global systems of inequity and injustice based on race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality and cultural identity. 3. Students will be able to explain and apply current human rights theoretical frameworks and analytical tools necessary for viewing film through diverse critical lenses. 4. Students will identify, explore, and challenge common stereotypes about Latin American peoples and cultures, often used to justify policies and practices leading to systemic inequity and injustice, as presented through media such as film. 5. Students will be able to articulate the ethics and consequencespros and consof film as a medium for sharing and discussing local human rights issues with a global audience.",
