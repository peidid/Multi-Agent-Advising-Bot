We will be using Python 3 and cover a number of topics from applied string operations, to chatting server, to statistical simulation, and to AI. This course is mainly designed for those who took 15110 andor 15112, and have not taken andor do not plan to take further CS courses. We will explore the applications of programming when build projects, to facilitate the use of programming to solve everyday problems, and to encourage further creations by programming.",
