Carnegie Mellon has been a leader in undergraduate research for decades. The Qatar Student Initiated Undergraduate Research Program (**QSIURP**) supports student-initiated research and encourages cross-disciplinary projects. It is designed to help qualified students develop research skills by working on projects that are driven by the students’ and the faculty advisor’s interests.

QSIURP awards funding to undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar for summer research in any field of study. It is modeled on a similar program on the main campus known as SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fund) and SURG (Small Undergraduate Research Grant).

QSIURP projects should be research, scholarly, or artistic activities that lead to one or more of the following:

-     -   The production of new knowledge.
      -   Increased problem solving capabilities, including design and analysis.
      -   Original, critical, or historical theory and interpretation.
      -   The production of art or artistic performance.

Important note: When preparing your proposal, please follow this [PROPOSAL TEMPLATE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YzNQx4MbTePnMAroS7ylDRu3vsAExIgj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112110434841059805124&rtpof=true&sd=true).

FUNDING DETAILS

There are two types of funding available: Fellowships (salary) and Grants. Individuals or groups (2 students max) may submit a proposal for a Fellowship, a Grant, or both.

-   **QSIURP Fellowships:** students may apply for up to ten weeks of summer research in any field of study. Students will be paid hourly (QAR44) and will have to fill out a time-sheet to be paid (maximum: Summer term days x 37.5 hours/week x QAR44/hour).
-   **QSIURP Grants** fund the purchase of supplies or equipment required for the awardees’ research under QSIURP. These grants are available for up to QAR3,650 for individual applicants and QAR7,300 for group applicants. Applicants could request for additional QSIURP grant funding if needed. However, approval is subjected to funding availability and valid justification.

Students applying as a group should submit one proposal and indicate which members are applying for Fellowship and what their roles are.

4.  Certificate of attendance of the mandatory workshop on proposal writing

#### **Reapplying students**

Previously awarded students are **exempt from attending the mandatory workshop on proposal writing** and should submit the following files, each including their name and Andrew ID:

1.  Resume for each student investigator (1 PDF file including the resumes of all applying team members)
2.  Proposal as outlined in the section “Proposal Writing Requirements” below (PDF file)

4.  The faculty adviser(s) for the previous QSIURP project must submit a QSIURP Advisor Recommendation reflecting on the applicant’s performance, skills and ability to conduct research.

#### **QSIURP ADVISOR RECOMMENDATION**

Faculty that agree to advise a student’s research project commit to provide active mentoring and guidance, in addition to approving a Progress and Final Report by their supervisee(s). If a project has more than one faculty supervisor, each faculty member should complete this form. This form must be submitted by **March 30, 2026 midnight**.

**The recommendation should highlight:**

-   The relevance of the research project and its outcome(s);
-   The credentials of the applicant student(s) that make him/her suited to conduct this research;
-   A clear supervision/communication plan for the duration of the research process.

#### **PROPOSAL WRITING REQUIREMENTS**

Proposals should include **six sections**. The maximum number of words allowed for sections 1-5 is **1500 words total**. Proposals will be **disqualified** for exceeding the word limit.

1.  **Abstract:** A summary of the research question and project design. Researchers typically write the abstract after they have finished writing the rest of the proposal. It should be a maximum of two paragraphs.
2.  **Research Question and Significance:** What is the question that you want to explore in your research and why is it an interesting and important question?  How would you explain to an educated reader in a news article the importance of your project? This is a good place to show that you are aware of the work that had already been done related to your question and what gap or need the research addresses.
3.  **Project Design and Tactical Plan:** How will you go about addressing your research question?
-   What will be your methodology?
-   What are your expected deliverables/results?
-   What is your timetable?
-   Is there any background work/reading that you have to do?
-   What is the research contribution?
1.  **Investigator qualifications and goals:** What courses or work experiences have prepared you to undertake this project? Why is it important to you? What are your career aspirations? What is your background? Have you worked on this project before? Is this part of an upcoming Senior Thesis? This section allows the reader to know you better as a person.
2.  **Budget and timeline:** Indicate the start and end dates of your project. Indicate what type of funding you are applying for (QSIURP fellowship only or QSIURP fellowship + QSIURP grant). Students submitting a proposal as a pair must each submit a budget for a Fellowship as an individual—no group awards (that would then be subdivided) are available. Students applying as a pair should indicate how many members are applying for Fellowship and what their roles are.
3.  **Bibliography of related work:** Include any references to external sources in a citation format appropriate for your major. (References are not counted towards the maximum number of words).

**Automatic disqualification: Failure to accurately site references** or **plagiarism** will result in automatic disqualification.

**Notes****:**

1- If your work is a production of art or artistic performance, explain for the “Research Question and Significance” why an audience might be engaged, delighted, or drawn to reflection because of the expression that you plan to explore. For the “Project Design and Tactical Plan,” what materials do you plan to work with and why? How does your exploration fit into work that has come before, and why do you want to link your art to their inspiration? Be sure to include reasons for your claims. Do not simply state that this work is an artistic exploration that you believe in very strongly. That kind of statement asks the reviewers to “trust” your claim rather than be convinced by your reasoning.

2- If the project requires the purchase of supplies or equipment, QSIURP offers up to QR3,650 grant money for each applicant. **The faculty mentor needs to submit a quote and EH&S approval for chemicals when submitting the recommendation letter.  
**

3- If the student required extra time to finalize writing the final report, an email should be sent to the QURC committee with a justification. Please note that this extension is not provided for conducting work on your project, but rather to finalize the report (i.e. unpaid)

PROPOSAL WRITING WORKSHOP (MANDATORY)

-   2 workshops on proposal writing will be offered in **February 16, 2026 & February 18, 2026**. [Letter of Intent & Sign up](https://forms.gle/fjy9J4qK6MJa38Ca6) for the workshop
-   **Each QSIURP applicant is required to attend ONE workshop.**
-   The goal of the workshops is to teach the students the skills of writing successful research proposals and of avoiding typical pitfalls and common mistakes. Through case studies based on prior proposals, the students will learn how to present their ideas in a structured and clear way to better explain their research project and to persuade external audience(s) that their project is feasible and valuable.
-   **Failure to attend the workshop** **will automatically disqualify the candidate** from the QSIURP application process (even if the full application package is submitted).
-   Specify the date of the workshop you’ll attend in the Letter of Intent (see the Application Process section above)

SELECTION CRITERIA

Applications will be reviewed by a committee consisting of representatives from the five majors (Biological Sciences, Business Administration, Computational Biology, Computer Science, and Information Systems), as well as at least one Arts and Sciences faculty member. Any member of the committee who is also listed as the advisor for a project will recuse him or herself from reviewing that application.

Accepted applications will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

1.  **Significance and clarity of research question(s)**
-   Does the project address a new or original need?
-   Do the project goals merit the expected duration of full-time work?
-   Are the project goals expressed clearly enough to guide project work?
-   How is your work different from, or how does it build on, prior work?
2.  **Feasibility of project design and supervision plan**
-   Can the work as described be completed within the projected time frame?
-   Is there a clear plan in place for how faculty advisors will provide supervision throughout the duration of the project?
-   Have potential difficulties for completion been anticipated?
3.  **Contribution to student’s academic or professional career**
-   Do student investigators have previous experiences that indicate they will be able to undertake the project?
-   Is there a clear indication of how the project will fit with the student investigators’ academic or professional trajectory?
-   Is it clear from the writing of the proposal that the student investigators are taking ownership of the project (i.e., it does not appear to have been written by the faculty advisor)?
4.  **Overall professionalism of the application packet**
-   Do the writing quality, attention to grammar and punctuation, and overall visual presentation of the proposal and resume indicate the student investigators’ professionalism (e.g., the ability to attend to details, record data correctly, represent the university in presentations about the research)?

Applications will be automatically **disqualified** in ANY of the following cases:

-   Failure to submit a Letter of Intent
-   Failure to attend one of the proposal writing workshops
-   Proposal sections 1-5 in total **exceed 1500 words**.
-   Plagiarism or inappropriate referencing

All QSIURP recipients will be expected to

-   Work **full-time** on the project (maximum 37.5 hours per week) for the expected duration unless specified differently in the proposal timeline;
-   **Not take classes** or **engage in other work (paid or unpaid)** during the period of the fellowship;
-   **Meet with Faculty Advisor regularly** during the course of the project to evaluate progress and overcome challenges.
-   Follow [IRB guidelines](https://www.cmu.edu/research-compliance/human-subjects-research/index.html) if the research involves human subjects (any questions concerning procedures or length of time required to secure IRB approval should go to the Research Office;
-   **Progress Report:** Submit a mid-project progress report of 2 pages maximum, between the start and end date provided in the student’s proposal. The report should highlight the progress made as described in the project timetable, the challenges met and the strategies used to tackle them. The progress report has to be approved by the Faculty Advisor before submitting it to the QSIURP Committee. Continuation of funding of the research project is contingent on approval of the progress report by the QSIURP Committee.
-   **Final Report:** Submit the Final Report on the research by the end date provided by the student and Faculty Advisor, i.e. the date mentioned in your Contract Letter. Most reports for projects other than artistic expressions will include: abstract, introduction, methods/procedures, results, conclusion/discussion, and references. Please download [**this final report template**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rZThAEdCbmHD2W439uINVUh5fbGoAeWa/view?usp=sharing) and ensure that all sections outlined are included in your final report
-   **Meeting of the Minds Presentation, April 2026:** Make a presentation of the work at the April 2026 Meeting of the Minds. Submission of the poster for participation in Meeting of the Minds must include prior approval of the project advisor.

Failure to satisfy these requirements may lead to the termination of research and/or will result in ineligibility for future awards.

SUPERVISOR AND STUDENT RESPONSIBILITY

**Both the QSIURP mentor and students are responsible for carrying out the funded research  
**

-   Once a faculty mentor commits to supervise a research project, he/she needs to ensure that the project objectives are met and that the deliverables are submitted on time.
-   If there are difficulties in conducting the research work, the faculty mentor and the student should inform the QURC in a timely fashion.
-   The QURC can take punitive measures in the case of continuous negligence in conducting the project.
