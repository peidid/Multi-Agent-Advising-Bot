**SURA Details and Requirements**

-   **What kind of research can I do?**  -   The research experiences will vary widely across projects. Students can work with faculty on existing faculty research or creative inquiry under the direction of a CMU-Q faculty member.

-   **Do I have to be in Qatar?**  -   Students are encouraged to be in Qatar for the entirety of their SURA experience. However, in some exceptional cases SURA may be remote. Permission will be granted case by case and depends on both permission from faculty and from the QURC committee.    -   _Note:_ _Location is carefully considered as some research activities may not be authorized or appropriate in some countries. There may also be concerns over data management that the CMU research office must review prior. N__ot all locations are permissible due to CMU-Q policy_.
          
      -   **Can I do SURA more than once?**    -   No, SURA is one-time limited opportunity, best to be completed in your first or second summer at CMU-Q.
          
      -   **Can two or more students work on one SURA project?**    -   Yes, this is up to you and your faculty mentor. Each student must fill out their own application form.
          
      -   **Can I have more than one faculty mentor?**    -   Yes, this is up to you and your faculty mentor.

      -   **Can SURA be completed after Summer?**    -   No, like all summer courses, the work must be completed by the end of the semester.

**SURA Deliverables**

-   Who determines my final grade?  -   The faculty supervisor determines the final grade based on their criteria and assessment of the project work and submission of the first draft of your poster outlining your SURA work due on June 28th.
    
-   How do I receive my final grade for my transcript?  -   **Receiving** **an official final grade (given to you by your faculty mentor) for your transcript is dependent on the provision of one or more SURA deliverables at the end of the semester.**
    
-   What are the SURA deliverables? The QURC committee requires a poster submission outlining your SURA work due on **June 28th** (form will be sent out). This poster will be presented during the Summer Research showcase in September 2026. (You can revise your poster before the showcase, but QURC requires minimally a first draft by June 28th). Please note that additional SURA deliverables may be defined by the faculty advisor together with the student prior to the application for SURA. The quality or content of the deliverable will not be assessed by the QURC committee or the Associate Dean for Research.
-   **Important**: The QURC committee together with the Associate Dean for Research reserve the right to give any student an incomplete grade who does not submit their SURA deliverable(s).

**SURA Poster Showcase and Meeting of the Minds**

-   SURA students are expected to showcase and present their SURA research to the CMU-Q community in the Fall semester (**Poster presentations-West Walkway: September, 2026**).
