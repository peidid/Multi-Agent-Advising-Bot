The Meeting of the Minds (MotM) is an annual CMU-Q symposium where students showcase their research to a wide audience, including faculty, fellow students, industry representatives, and the larger community in Qatar. As a research-focused institution, CMU-Q is committed to fostering a culture of inquiry and innovation, and MotM is a key part of this mission. The Meeting of the Minds 2026 is scheduled for **Tuesday, April 28, 2026** (Reading Day).

We strongly encourage all CMU-Q students, regardless of major, involved in SURA, QSIURP, Honors Thesis, or any other undergraduate research during the Summer 2025, Fall 2025 or Spring 2026 semesters to participate. This event is an excellent opportunity to present your research findings, learn about others’ work, network, and practice technical communication skills. A committee of CMU-Q faculty and external judges will evaluate the posters and select the winners.
