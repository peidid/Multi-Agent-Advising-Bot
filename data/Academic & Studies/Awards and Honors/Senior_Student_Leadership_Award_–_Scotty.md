The Senior Student Leadership Award is presented annually by Student Affairs to graduating seniors who have demonstrated extraordinary leadership and made substantial contributions to the community during their time at Carnegie Mellon Qatar. While we have many talented and involved students in this graduating class, this recognition is reserved for those students who have made an unparalleled impact on our community and served as an inspirational role model for other students. In other words, these individuals leave Carnegie Mellon a better place as a result of their vision, leadership, initiative and contributions to the community and this institution.

The following areas of impact may assist you in framing your nominations:

**Community Development**  
Students display unparalleled leadership via active engagement in campus organizations and broad-based campus improvement initiatives. These students contribute to the metacurricular experience at Carnegie Mellon through sustained community-oriented activity in clubs and student organizations, residential house communities, advisory councils, student government, or other student leadership roles. These students devote a substantial amount of effort in support of others, actively seeking opportunities to help others learn, grow and develop as individuals in areas related to wellness, diversity, spirituality and social responsibility. Nominees may also utilize their individual leadership skills to foster a more diverse and inclusive community at Carnegie Mellon.

**Civic Engagement**  
Students display unparalleled leadership as they leverage their individual skills, through volunteer and/or philanthropic initiatives, to positively impact the CMU-Q Doha, CMU Pittsburgh, and/or global community. These outstanding students exemplify a commitment to the sustainability of their efforts and an understanding of the needs of the community.

**Athletics**  
Students display unparalleled leadership by playing a significant role in athletic life through participation on campus athletic teams, sustained involvement in intramural activities or club sports, or commitment to advancing appreciation for the Carnegie Mellon recreational sports community. They embrace the role of being a scholar athlete and exhibit leadership, teamwork, and sportsmanship both on and off the field through understanding of self and consistent demonstration of their values. These students actively seek opportunities to help teammates learn, grow and develop as individuals.

**Academics and Research**  
Students display unparalleled leadership by demonstrating superior aptitude in their academic field of study while advancing research and making unique contributions to the intellectual life of the campus community. Through their work product, research, and initiatives, they drive progress and solutions to problems. Nominees may engage in focused, individualized work on a sustained independent project; enhance the community’s commitment to academic excellence; utilize creative and novel methods for leading and supporting their fellow students in their academic pursuits; or demonstrate superior initiative in applying knowledge in the community.

**Arts**  
Students display unparalleled leadership by utilizing their artistic talents and inquiry as a means of self-exploration or as a community catalyst. The contributions of the nominee have served to enhance opportunities for artistic development and appreciation within the Carnegie Mellon community. Nominees may also utilize their artistic talents to promote community development, reflect diversity towards encouraging inclusion, and facilitate conversations surrounding societal issues.
