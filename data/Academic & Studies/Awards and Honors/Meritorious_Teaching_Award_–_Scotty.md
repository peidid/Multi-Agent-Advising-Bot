#### Purpose of the award

During graduation each year, CMUQ honors a faculty member for their commitment to teaching and education. Students are invited to nominate a faculty who they feel most embody the inscription on the award: “**_Given for unusual devotion and effectiveness in teaching undergraduate students_**“.

#### Eligibility

Students at CMUQ are invited to nominate any one of their professors from any semester during their studies at Carnegie Mellon. However, professors must have taught at CMU in Qatar either Fall 2024 or Spring 2025.  Students may nominate one professor only.

**This is a lifetime award. Past winners are hence not eligible.** Check out past winners [here.](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/teaching-award/meritorious-teaching-award-winners-2/)

#### Nomination Deadline

Nominations must be received no later than March 20, 2025 midnight.

#### Nomination Process

Students should submit their nominations using the [Nominate page](https://forms.gle/Sb4hPexKFumbiJr26).  Once applications close, a committee of CMU-Q faculty will convene and select the winner for the Meritorious Teaching Award.
