Where is the ARC located in the building?

The ARC is located on the ground floor of the CMUQ building, just past the men’s prayer room from the East walkway of the building. Here’s a [map](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/map-to-arc/) to the Academic Resource Center. GPS coordinates for the Academic Resource Center are [25°19’00.8″N 51°26’20.4″E](https://maps.google.com/?q=25.316874,51.438991&hl=en-US&gl=us)

What are the normal working hours for ARC?

The ARC is open Sunday through Thursday from 7:00 am until 5:30 pm. ARC staff tutors hold regular business hours each day, which are listed on the bulletin board outside the Center. Many student Course Assistants hold office hours, and their availability can be checked at the bulletin board outside the center or [here](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/hours-location/).

Are the tutoring sessions free of charge?

All of the ARC’s services are free of charge to students currently enrolled in CMUQ courses. There are no additional fees.

Are appointments required?

Drop-in service is available for all course assistants listed on the [Google Calendar](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/hours-location/) for that listed time. Some Course Assistants are [also/only](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-resource-center/book-an-appointment/) available to meet by appointment.

In order to meet with a staff tutor, it is best to schedule an appointment in advance.

Please [schedule an appointment](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-resource-center/book-an-appointment/) to arrange support for the relevant course.

How often should I visit the center?

You may visit the center as much as you want! However to be fair to the entire student body, we ask that you limit visits to 5 hours per week.  The idea behind the center is to help assist you in acquiring skills so ideally you won’t need to visit the center at all. If you feel you are failing a class or need intensive help, weekly tutoring is available.

Does working with a tutor or CA mean I'm not ready for college?

Working with a tutor is in no way a failure. We often see ‘A’ or ‘B’ students who want to discuss a topic more in depth, get a different viewpoint, or ask questions. Working with a tutor does not single you out in any way. If anything, it shows that you care about your school work!

What can be expected from a session at the ARC?

Our primary objective at the ARC is to help students become independent learners. To this end, staff and Course Assistants are trained to assist students in identifying appropriate study strategies and in developing practices and skills that lead to academic success. As with most other practices, learning is a process, so the amount of time and effort invested is proportionate to results. Plan to arrive to your appointments on time, prepared and focused.

When is the best time to see a writing spcialist/tutor about a paper?

You may ask tutors for assistance at any time during the writing process — for brainstorming, prewriting, drafting, revising, or editing — but come prepared with some ideas for the paper or questions about the assignment. The ARC does not hold writing appointments by email, so you will need to come in and work with a writing tutor.

What if I don't like my tutor?

If you don’t hit it off with a tutor, make an [appointment](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-resource-center/book-an-appointment/) to work with someone else. Tutor and CA availability times are also posted on the bulletin board outside the center and [online](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-resource-center/). You may always talk to the Director of the Center if you feel the problem is more serious.

Will my grades improve?

Tutors and CAs are not responsible for the grades you receive. However, grades may improve over a semester’s period of work — not necessarily as a result of one or two visits to the center. Don’t expect a “quick-fix”! To be a successful, independent learner, it takes time.

How can I become a CA in the ARC?

The ARC hires new Course Assistants (CAs) each semester for specific courses. If you have a desire to help your peers make the most of their academic experience, we encourage you to consider applying. Watch for announcements on this [page](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-resource-center/undergraduate-student-employment/) to find out how to submit your application.
