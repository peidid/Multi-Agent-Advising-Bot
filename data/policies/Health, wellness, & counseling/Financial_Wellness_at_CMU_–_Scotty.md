Personal financial well-being is more than just being able to balance a checkbook, compare prices or get a job. It also includes skills like long-term vision and planning for the future, and the discipline to use those skills every day.  
Carnegie Mellon is committed to student financial well-being and future success, so we encourage you to take advantage of the resources available here to help you better understand your student loan debt and repayment options, as well as how to ensure you stay financially fit!
