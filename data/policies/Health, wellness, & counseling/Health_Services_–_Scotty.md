Flu Vaccination

The best way to prevent seasonal flu is to get vaccinated each year.  The Flu vaccine is available seasonally beginning in October at the QF-PHCC and other medical facilities within Qatar.  Flu season begins in October and typically lasts through April.

**Prevention Tips**

In addition to getting vaccinated here are a few tips to help prevent infection:

-   cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing by using tissues or the crook of your elbow.
-   avoid touching your mouth and face after touching public surfaces like doorknobs and keyboards.
-   wash your hands often with soap and water.

Medical Excuses Guidelines

Routine illnesses, emergencies and exacerbations of chronic conditions may interfere with class attendance and completion of assigned work. Students are encouraged to review attendance policies in the course syllabus and resolve issues of class absence or missed work assignments with their professors directly.

The Health & Wellness Office at Carnegie Mellon University Qatar does not provide medical excuses for missed classes. It is recommended that students promptly contact their professors and instructors when they anticipate time out of class due to a medical concern.

If a student does not want to disclose their personal health information, the Office of Health & Wellness is prepared to validate the medical report and notify the professor(s) via email. However, medical reports will only be validated if they are dated, signed by the treating physician and written on the same physician’s letterhead or prescription pad.
