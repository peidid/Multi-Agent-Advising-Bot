Last Updated on July 2, 2025 by Amie Jo Rollins

To improve the health and wellness of all students at CMU-Q, Student Health Insurance Policy & Guidelines are in effect. To extend access to private health insurance benefits our  students will automatically be enrolled in a private health insurance plan, Seib Insurance & Reinsurance.  It is the students’ responsibility to understand the health benefits, including the exclusions and limitations throughout the policy.

All students may want to remain covered under their current private health insurance plan and enroll in university insurance to maximize health care coverage. Please compare any private insurance policy with the Seib Insurance & Reinsurance plan to make a decision about waiving. Please find a [User Guide](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carnegie-Mellon-University-User-Guide-2023-2024-1-2-1-1.pdf) attached to help you navigate Seib Insurance Plan and Details.

Waiving Health Insurance

All students may choose to waive out of the University-sponsored insurance if they have private health insurance that meets the University’s minimum health insurance requirements (a Hamad Health Card is not considered private health insurance).

To request to waive the university offered health insurance the following steps must be completed:

1.  Contact the insurance provider or the HR Department of the company providing the coverage for their employees to verify if the insurance coverage provided meets the University’s [health insurance requirements](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/health-and-wellness/health-insurance/health-insurance-waiver-requirements/).
2.  If the above requirements are met, please submit:  1.  a copy of the summary of benefits
      2.  a signed [Insurance Waiver Form](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Medical_Insurance_Waiver_Form.pdf)
      3.  a copy of your health insurance card

The deadline to submit this information is no later than **July 1**.  Any documents received after this date will not be processed and you will be responsible for the premium charge. The insurance waiver is subject to approval by the Director of Health and Wellness and is dependent on documentation that is received.  All documents need to be submitted to Health Connect.  For your privacy, we do not accept documents via email.

**Failure to submit all necessary documents by the respective deadlines will result in automatic enrollment in the Seib plan, and the student will be responsible for the fee charged to their student account.**
