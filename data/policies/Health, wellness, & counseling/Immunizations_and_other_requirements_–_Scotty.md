What are the required immunizations for incoming students?

All full-time incoming students must complete the online immunization form and tuberculosis (TB) screening questionnaire, documenting the following immunizations before arrival on campus. Failure to comply will result in your ability to enroll in classes.

-   **Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR)** – Birth in the US before 1956, **or** two doses of the MMR vaccine, **or** two doses of separate measles and mumps and one dose of rubella vaccine, or positive MMR IgG surface antibodies, meets the requirement.
-   **Varicella (Chickenpox)** – Birth in the US before 1980, a history of chickenpox disease, a positive varicella IgG surface antibody, or two doses of the vaccine meets the requirement.
-   **Polio –** Four doses primary series of the poliovirus (OPV), inactivated poliovirus (IPV), or OPV/IPV sequentially or one booster dose after age 18 meets the requirement.
-   **Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap) –** Four doses primary series in childhood, and one booster of Tdap within the last 10 years meets the requirement.
-   **Meningococcal Quadrivalent (Meningitis) –** Booster dose administered at or after the age of 16 years.  If you received this immunization before the age of 16, a booster dose is required.

**Tuberculosis (TB)Screening –** We accept a negative tuberculin skin test (PPD), a negative chest X-ray, **or** a negative IGRA blood test completed within 6 months of the start of your classes at CMU-Q.

-   _Note:_   -   _Positive PPD results will require a follow-up with a healthcare provider and a QFT-G blood test if no history of the disease._ 
      -   _Previous history of the disease requires a medical report indicating a normal chest x-ray._ 
      -   _BCG vaccinated persons are NOT exempt and required to complete the TB Screening._

Blood titers may be substituted as proof of immunity in lieu of vaccinations.  Copies of blood work must be uploaded using Health Connect.

How do I access Health Connect?

When you have your Andrew ID, you can access all of our online forms in [Health Connect.](https://healthservices.qatar.cmu.edu/)

**Note:** in order to access Health Connect, your birthdate in the Student Information System (SIO) must be correct. If you are unable to access Health Connect, check your birthdate in SIO. If it is incorrect, correct it at the [HUB](http://www.cmu.edu/hub/ "Carnegie Mellon University HUB"). The following day, it should be updated in Health Connect. If you still have problems, the [Office of Health and Wellness](mailto:health-wellness@qatar.cmu.edu) for assistance.

I have a copy of my immunization record - can I send it to you?

No, we do not accept immunization records for incoming students by mail, fax, or email.  All incoming students must complete the online immunization form and TB screening questionnaire through Health Connect.

What if I do not have all the completed immunizations by the due date?

Submit your immunization forms prior to the due date with your current information.  We will review the information and contact you via your andrew email account to notify you if you are missing any requirements.

What if my country does not have a required immunization?

All required vaccines and testing are to be completed prior to arrival on campus, per the [immunization policy](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/immunizations.html).  Getting vaccinations in Qatar can prove to be challenging at times, once you arrive you will be very busy with orientation/classes, so if you are able to get all the vaccinations in your home country I would strongly recommend that.  If you are unable to get a particular vaccination in your home country you can get it in Qatar.  We can discuss the options to receive the outstanding immunization once you receive your residency permit for Qatar.

Can I request to waive an immunization?

Yes, if an immunization conflicts with your religious/personal beliefs, or is not advised for medical reasons.  To request a waiver, complete the [Request For Exemption From University Required Immunizations](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Request-for-Exemption-from-University-Required-Immunizations.pdf) form that indicates why the vaccination conflicts with your religious/personal beliefs.  If you have a medical reason for not receiving a vaccination, the [Request For Exemption From University Required Immunization](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Request-for-Exemption-from-University-Required-Immunizations.pdf) form must be signed by your healthcare provider.  The form must be received by the immunization due date for your incoming semester.  If a contagious disease outbreak occurs, the university reserves the right to ask students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until the outbreak is over.

Submit the form to the [Office of Health and Wellness](mailto:health-wellness@qatar.cmu.edu)

Should I submit my health information and documents through Health Connect if I am awaiting my financial aid package?

We would recommend that you review the requirements for the immunizations and screening to determine what immunizations and screenings are still needed.  This way if you do decide to matriculate at CMU-Q then you will already have completed the necessary requirements.
