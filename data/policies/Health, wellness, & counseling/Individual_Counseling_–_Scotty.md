Individual counseling provides students an opportunity to meet with the psychologist on a one-on-one basis and discuss issues that are hindering their personal and academic growth. Counseling helps students address personal issues, such as depression, stress, anxiety, adjustment to university life, feelings of homesickness, self-esteem, and relationship issues.

In addition to individual counseling, the Office of CaPS-Q also offers group programs to students that help them develop self-resilience, self-awareness, effective coping strategies, build self-esteem, self-confidence and improve their interpersonal skills.
