#### [**Academic Integrity Actions**](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html)

Carnegie Mellon’s Academic Integrity Actions is the university procedure for disciplinary actions against undergraduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations. [Academic Integrity Actions](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-integrity-actions/index.html) are penalties or sanctions imposed for violation of the [University Policy of Academic Integrity](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html), and include cheating, plagiarism, or unauthorized assistance. For the Qatar campus, Academic Responsibility Panels (ARP) and Administrative Resolution Meetings (ARM) run at the request of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and university level decisions related to academic integrity are made by the Senior Associate Dean of Education.

**FOR STUDENTS**

-   [Responding to Academic Integrity Violations](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocr/students/undergrad%20responding/index.html)

**FOR FACULTY**  
Faculty that are wanting to report academic integrity violations can use the [Academic Integrity Reporting Form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?CarnegieMellonUniv&layout_id=20) to submit their concerns. This form should be completed by faculty members to submit reports of academic dishonesty for documentation. We also have a [template letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G1U-tSTe81GNU8_tSc9O3wo8ZcENHvge/edit) that can be used by faculty when addressing an academic integrity violation with a student. The letter and any evidence to support the integrity violation should be included in the Academic Integrity Reporting Form.

Questions regarding the undergraduate policies and/or procedures pertaining to academic integrity violations should be directed to Dina Al-Abdi, our Coordinator of Community Standards, Dabdi@qatar.cmu.edu
