# Academic Integrity Actions Procedures

Page owner: Sara Al-Sabbagh  
Last Updated on July 29, 2024 by Sara Al-Sabbagh

Academic integrity actions are outcomes imposed when any student violates the [University Policy on Academic Integrity](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html) including cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.

#### Statute of Limitations

There is no statute of limitations that precludes course instructors from acting on the discovery of alleged violations either during the semester of enrollment in the course in question or after the course has concluded including after the student(s) has graduated.

#### Important Definitions

-   **Academic Advisor**: The individual designated in SIO/S3 as the primary major academic advisor. The Academic Advisor may be designated by the department to disseminate relevant correspondence related to academic integrity action within the department according to departmental procedure.
-   **Academic Integrity Action**: Academic integrity actions are outcomes imposed for violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity including cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.
-   **Academic Integrity Liaison**: Each department designates an individual who is trained by the Office of Community Responsibility  to provide guidance to course instructors in cases of alleged violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. Absent a departmental designation, the associate dean of the college in which the course is housed is the default liaison for consultation purposes.
-   Associate Dean: The individual designated in SIO/S3 as the Associate Dean of the student’s home college or a designee appointed by the named Associate Dean to act on their behalf. 
-   **Course Failure**: An assigned grade of “R” for a specific course as outlined in the University Policy on Grading.
-   **Course Instructor**: Any person responsible for the instruction or grading of a course at the university as documented in the Schedule of Classes.
-   **Department Head**: The university faculty or staff member who leads an academic department. In academic integrity cases in which the home department is an academic program, the program director is considered to be the department head.
-   **Email**: The official Carnegie Mellon University email address designated in the university directory.
-   **Moderator**: The Student Affairs staff member who facilitates an Academic Review Meeting and/or Academic Responsibility Panel. Moderators are appointed and trained by the Office of Community Responsibility. The meetings run at their discretion according to process guidelines.
-   **Process Advisor**: As a staff member in the Office of Community Responsibility, the Process Advisor is responsible for the logistics of convening an Academic Review Meeting and/or Academic Responsibility Panel. The Process Advisor schedules the panel, assembles the panel, informs the involved parties of the procedures for the panel, and manages other administrative tasks.
-   **Student**: Any person registered for, enrolled in, or auditing any course(s) at Carnegie Mellon University at the time of the alleged violation. An individual is also considered to be a student if they have been accepted for admission to the university but are not currently matriculating. Examples include but are not limited to, students who are enrolled but not taking classes due to an academic break, medical leave, suspension, or other personal leave; students who were enrolled at the time of the incident; persons who demonstrate an intent to enroll by registering for courses; and students participating in study abroad programs. Because there is no statute of limitations for academic integrity violations and proceedings can be commenced after a student has left the university or graduated, “student” also includes former students.
-   **Student’s Home College**: The college is designated in SIO/S3 as the student’s department of enrollment.
-   **Student’s Home Department**: The department designated in SIO/S3 as the student’s department of enrollment.
-   **Support Person**: A person of the student’s choosing who accompanies the student during the Academic Responsibility Panel. The support person does not participate in the proceedings but may advise the student and/or be present at an Academic Responsibility Panel. Registered support persons are not permitted to participate as witnesses in the same proceedings.

#### Course Level Review, Decision, and Action

Incidents of alleged violations of the University’s Policy on Academic Integrity will be initially reviewed and adjudicated at the course level or the equivalent academic level for projects that involve research  or creative inquiry. Investigations may be managed by the course instructor(s) or departmental designee. In all cases involving alleged violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity, the following procedures apply:

#### Gathering Information

1.  Suspected violations should be investigated within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within one to two weeks of discovering the alleged violation.
2.  Instructors should notify the involved student(s) of the alleged violation(s) and provide the student(s) the opportunity to respond in an in-person meeting or by phone or videoconference as circumstances warrant.
3.  Course instructors may receive information from other individuals (e.g., students, staff, faculty) who possess direct information related to the alleged violation(s) under review. For example, someone may have observed the suspected incident or interacted directly with the involved student(s) before, during, or after the incident in question.
4.  When discussing alleged violations with the involved student(s) or witnesses, instructors should avoid revealing the identity of other involved parties unless it is necessary in order to determine responsibility.
5.  If a student does not respond to notification of an alleged violation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity, the matter may be reviewed in their absence by the course instructor after a reasonable period of time. In these circumstances, the course instructor may proceed with determination of responsibility and outcome.

#### Determining Responsibility and Course Level Action

1.  The course instructor will decide whether the suspected violation(s) occurred based on available evidence. At this stage, instructors are encouraged to consult with the department’s designated Academic Integrity Liaison, department/program head, the college dean’s office, or the Office of Community Responsibility regarding the nature of the suspected violation(s), the nature of the evidence related to the alleged violation(s), and the range of outcomes under consideration.
2.  When assessing responsibility for an academic integrity violation, the course instructor should apply a preponderance of the evidence standard. A preponderance of the evidence means that the course instructor has determined that it is more likely than not that the student has violated the University Policy on Academic Integrity.
3.  If the course instructor concludes that the student is responsible for the alleged violation(s), the course instructor should determine an outcome. The most severe outcome that can be assessed at this level of review and action is course failure although the instructors and/or department heads may recommend additional outcomes for consideration during an Academic Review Meeting.
4.  Students who have pending or documented academic integrity action may not drop the course in question (including the use of a voucher). Students who drop the course will be manually re-enrolled in the course and further outcomes may result.

In extremely rare circumstances a student may withdraw from the course in question provided they receive explicit approval from the course instructor, primary advisor and associate dean of their home college in consultation with the Office of Community Responsibility. Students who withdraw from a course without the proper permissions will be manually re-enrolled in the course and further outcomes may result.

5\. Students who have pending or documented academic disciplinary action may not change a course to P/NP (including the use of a voucher).

#### Documenting and Reporting Course Level Decision

1.  After determining responsibility and outcomes for a violation(s), the instructor should immediately and in writing via email notify the involved student(s) of the decision. If found responsible, the rationale for the determination of responsibility should be included in that notification. The outcome(s) that the course instructor has assessed should be noted as well. Students should also be informed of the opportunity to request an appeal and the procedures for doing so.
2.  All documented violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity should be reported to the Office of Community Responsibility upon completion of the investigation and student notification. Reports should be submitted using the [Academic Integrity Reporting Form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?CarnegieMellonUniv&layout_id=3).
3.  A copy of the email communication to the student should be included with the report. Course instructors are also encouraged to submit all evidence and supporting documentation.
4.  Upon receipt of the violation report, the Office of Community Responsibility  will notify the following individuals of the course-level decision and action:  -   Head of the student’s home department
      5.   Associate dean of the student’s home college
      6.   Academic advisor for the student
      7.   Head of department in which the course is registered (if different from the student’s department)
      8.   Associate dean of the college in which the course is registered (if different from the student’s college)
    
5.  Students will receive official notification that the report has been received from the Office of Community Responsibility. The notification will include an invitation to meet with a process advisor in the Office of Community Responsibility to discuss the case, review the appeal process, and prepare for an Academic Review Meeting  (if needed).
6.  In addition to the above notifications, the Office of CommunityResponsibility will be responsible for coordinating all Academic Review Meetings, Academic Responsibility Panels, course level decisions, and actions and documenting the violation in the student’s university conduct record consistent with the university policy on Academic Integrity Action Records Retention and Reporting.

#### Appeals of Course Level Action

When a student has received official notification of course-level action from the Office of Community Responsibility, a student has seven calendar days to request an appeal of course-level action. All requests for appeal must be submitted in writing to the Office of Community Responsibility. 

The written appeal request must indicate whether the student is appealing the finding of responsibility, the outcome, or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The basis of an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following:

-   A gross error in the procedural process that materially affected the outcome;
-   Inconsistency between the available evidence and the finding(s) of responsibility in the course-level review;
-   Stated course-level outcome(s) of failure in the course(s) that was not commensurate with the violation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity for which the student was found responsible; and
-   New information, which was not reasonably available at the time of the course-level review, merits re-consideration of the final disposition.

The vice president for student affairs or designee will review the written appeal request and determine whether, in their judgment, the appeal presents an appealable issue that warrants review by an Academic Responsibility Panel.

Should the vice president for student affairs or designee determine that sufficient grounds exist for further review, the Academic Responsibility Panel will adjudicate the appeal in a proceeding with the participation of the course instructor(s) or designee and the involved student, both of whom are required to participate in the proceedings. The purpose of the proceedings will be to make a recommendation to the vice provost for education or designee as to whether the course instructor’s initial decision should be upheld, vacated, or modified based on a preponderance of the evidence standard. A preponderance of the evidence means that it is more likely than not that the student violated the University Policy on Academic Integrity.

The course instructor(s) will be asked to provide all documentation related to the case if not already submitted, including the email to the student documenting the course-level action and supporting evidence related to the violation, to be considered by the Academic Responsibility Panel. Appropriate redaction will be made by the Office of Community Responsibility prior to panel member review.

In the event of an appeal at the end of a semester, an incomplete grade will be assigned pending the outcome of the appeal process.

#### Academic Review Meeting

When a second (or higher) violation is reported to the Office of Community Responsibility  (OCR or there is a request for additional action and the violation is not being appealed, a meeting will be scheduled with the following individuals:  

-   Office of Community Responsibility Academic Integrity liaison of the student’s home college or designee;
-   Associate Dean or designee of the student’s home college; 
-   Associate Dean of the college in which the course is registered (second violation) or designee; 
-   The student;
-   The Course Instructor(s) or designee(s) for the violations will be invited but are not required to attend the meeting.

This group will discuss the reported violations and the factors (including mitigating or aggravating circumstances) that led to these violations. The group will be provided access to all relevant documentation related to the violation(s) under review. After discussing the violations, the student and faculty, if present, will leave the meeting and the Associate Deans group will determine the appropriate outcome(s) for the number of violations that are being reviewed. The typical outcome(s) for a student with two violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity  includes a one or two-semester suspension and Restorative Outcomes. Additional and/or severe violations may increase the length of separation, including the possibility of permanent separation (expulsion). 

These outcome(s) will be communicated in writing to the student by the Office of Community Responsibility representative. The student or the course instructor and/or student’s department head or designee may submit a request for appeal in writing to the Provost within seven (7) days of being notified of the outcome(s) under the following circumstances:

-   The outcomes determined during the academic review meeting were not commensurate with the violation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity for which the student is responsible;
-   New information, which was not reasonably available at the time of the review, merits re-consideration of the final disposition.

The Office of Community Responsibility will send a copy of the final outcome letter to the following individuals:

-   Course instructor(s)
-   Head of the student’s home department
-   Associate dean of the student’s home college
-   Academic advisor for the student
-   Head of department in which the course(s) is housed (if different from the student’s department)
-   Associate dean of the college in which the course(s) is housed (if different from the student’s college)

#### Academic Responsibility Panel

The Academic  Responsibility Panel has jurisdiction in the following cases:

Appeals of a course instructor’s course-level decision as outlined above; or  Upon recommendation from an Academic Review Meeting.

#### Composition of the Academic Responsibility Panel

Each case presented to the Academic  Responsibility Panel is heard by two student panel members and three faculty panel members. The panel for any case must include at least one member from the college(s) represented by the parties. When possible, the panel for any case must include at least one student member at the same degree level as the student who is appearing before the panel. In addition, a trained moderator presides over the proceedings.

The faculty panel members will be appointed by the Office of Community Responsibility in consultation with the Faculty Senate. The student panel members will be appointed by the Office of Community Responsibility in consultation with the Undergraduate Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly following a selection process coordinated by the Office of Community Responsibility. All appointees must complete initial and ongoing training in order to be eligible to serve as panel members. Once trained, panel members may complete up to three years of service, and panel members may be reappointed.

Members participating in a given panel will be selected from a list of eligible individuals based upon availability and disinterestedness in the case or parties following review by the student who is appearing before the Academic Responsibility Panel. The involved course instructor(s), department head or designee, and panel members will also have the opportunity to note any potential conflicts of interest. The following circumstances would preclude participation as a panel member in a given proceedings :

-   Individuals with prior substantial knowledge of or interest in the student(s) involved or the case(s) under review
-   Individuals who may appropriately be a witness in the case(s)

#### Conduct of Academic Responsibility Panel

The university attempts to ensure fair, timely and orderly procedures in all academic integrity actions. To provide for this, the university has adopted the following procedural protections. The following is a list of procedures that govern the Academic Responsibility Panel  process:

#### **Panel** **Preparation and Scheduling**

1.  In advance of the panel , the members of the Academic Responsibility Panel will be provided a pre-read packet, which may include, among other relevant items: the initial academic integrity violation report(s); any supporting documentation related to the violation(s); any departmental recommendations for outcomes (if applicable); and a written introduction from the student to the panel.
2.  The student may submit a written introduction and up to three written letters of support by a date specified by the process advisor. Additional information that is relevant to the review including email correspondence and assignment documentation may be submitted by the student. This documentation will be included in the pre-read packet at the discretion of the process advisor.
3.  It is the responsibility of the Office of Community Responsibility to ensure that times set for panels are reasonable and that necessary accommodations have been offered to both the student and course instructor(s) whenever appropriate. In turn, both the student and course instructors(s) will be expected to demonstrate good-faith efforts in their participation in this process, particularly in relation to the scheduling of the panel. If a case involves exigent circumstances that prevent the student or course instructor(s) from participating in a scheduled review, the panel will be rescheduled.
4.  Every effort will be made to avoid conflicts with a student’s class schedule when identifying a meeting date and time. When circumstances warrant, classroom attendance, except for scheduled examinations, will not be a reasonable excuse for delaying a review.

#### **Panel** **Process and Procedures** 

1.  Information provided during an Academic Responsibility Panel  must be kept confidential by all parties. The student is provided a full copy of all materials provided to the panel  for the purpose of preparing for or use during the proceedings , consistent with the privacy rights of those involved. These materials are to be kept confidential and may be shared only with permission from the process advisor. These documents may not be duplicated nor utilized for any other purpose. All materials provided to the student must be returned to the process advisor at the conclusion of the proceedings and no copies may be retained..
2.  In order to maintain a fair and equitable process, no new materials will be accepted on the day of the panel, with the exception of (i) oral testimony and (ii) such other

evidence as may be necessary to rebut new oral testimony. Evidence offered as rebuttal will be accepted only at the discretion of the moderator.

3.  Prior to the panel, the student, course instructor(s), department head, or designee who are participating in the review will be asked if they believe that the potential panel members are biased for or against them. If a perceived bias is reasonable, replacements will be chosen for the panel and the proceedings will be rescheduled.
4.  The student has the right to have one person of their choosing present at the panel. The student is required to notify the process advisor of their support person of choice at a date specified by the process advisor which will be at least three days in advance. If legal counsel will serve in this capacity, the panel may determine that it wishes to secure legal advice in connection with the proceedings. Legal counsel or any other support person, if present, will not be permitted to participate in the proceedings but may advise the student and/or be present at a panel. In the event that one party to a case is accompanied by legal counsel without advance notice, a panel may be postponed until all parties to the case have had an opportunity to have counsel present. Registered support persons are not permitted to participate as witnesses in the same proceedings.
5.  Witnesses may be registered for each Academic ResponsibilityPanel  by the student, course instructor(s), and department head. Witnesses should be able to provide direct information related to the case(s) under review by the panel, such as direct observation of the incident(s) in question and/or direct interaction with any of the parties before, during, or after the incident in question. All parties are required to notify the process advisor of their registered witnesses at a date specified by the process advisor which will be at least three days in advance of the Academic Responsibility Panel
6.  In scheduling a panel, consideration should be given to allow that witnesses significant to the case being heard are available to the panel. If a witness is not available to be called by the panel in person or via telecommunication, they may submit a written statement to the process advisor to be reviewed if the panel requests information from the witness. Except in documented extenuating circumstances, students are expected to make a good-faith effort to provide information to the Academic Responsibility Panel when called as a witness.
7.  It is within the discretion of the panel to determine whether they wish to hear from suggested witnesses. Witnesses will be questioned one at a time by the panel and subsequently dismissed. They should be present in the room only when providing information to the panel.
8.  All proceedings, except the deliberation of the panel members, will be audio-recorded. Recordings will be kept in accordance with academic integrity action records retention practices.
9.  During the actual proceedings, the student has the right to be present during the presentation of evidence.
10.  Students and course instructors who are participating in a panel will be limited to ten minutes for their introduction and five minutes to provide a summary following the presentation of evidence.
11.  The majority of the proceedings will consist of questioning from the panel members for all parties as well as registered witnesses. Students and course instructors will also have the opportunity to present questions for the panel’s consideration.
12.  Following each summary, the panel will enter closed deliberations.
13.  In cases that involve appeals of course-level action, no information about the student’s prior violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity will be shared with the Academic Responsibility Panel.

#### **Panel** **Outcome Determination and Notifications**

1.  A representative of the Office of Community Responsibility will be responsible for notifying the vice provost for education or designee in writing of the recommendation of the panel.
2.  The vice provost for education or designee makes the decision in the case, informed by the recommendation of the Academic Responsibility Panel. The vice provost for education or designee may accept, reject, or modify the recommendation, or may remand the matter to a new Academic Responsibility Panel for review.
3.  After reviewing the recommendations and rendering a decision, the vice provost for education or designee will notify the student in writing of their decision.
4.  The Office of Community Responsibility  will send a copy of the final decision  letter to the following individuals:  -   Course instructor(s)
      5.   Head of the student’s home department
      6.   Associate dean of the student’s home college
      7.   Academic advisor for the student
      8.   Head of department in which the course(s) is housed (if different from the student’s department)
      9.   Associate dean of the college in which the course(s) is housed (if different from the student’s college)
    
5.  Parents of a student will not be notified of any academic integrity action, except as permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
6.  Academic integrity actions will be recorded in the student’s educational record in the Office of Community Responsibility in accordance with academic integrity action records retention practices. When academic integrity actions affect eligibility for enrollment, designation on other university records will be made. Academic integrity action records will not be released as a part of the official transcript of the academic record of a student.

#### Appeal of Academic Responsibility Panels

A student may appeal a decision delivered by the vice provost for education or designee following the Academic Responsibility Panel by submitting a request for appeal in writing via email to the provost of the university within seven calendar days of the official notification of the decision.

In cases in which the Academic Responsibility Panel decision pertains to an appeal of course-level action, the course instructor may submit a request for appeal in writing to the provost of the university within seven calendar days of the official notification of the decision. In cases in which the Academic Responsibility Panel decision pertains to matters that involve multiple violation reports or requests for additional outcomes, the course instructor and/or student’s department head or designee may submit a request for appeal in writing to the provost of the university within seven calendar days of the official notification of the decision.

The written appeal request should indicate whether the appeal concerns the finding(s) of responsibility, the outcome(s), or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The basis of an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following cases:

-   A gross error in procedural process that materially affected the outcome;
-   The outcomes imposed during the second-level review were not commensurate with the violation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity for which the student was found responsible;
-   Inconsistency between the available evidence and the finding(s) of responsibility in the course- level action appeal review or review meeting;
-   New information, which was not reasonably available at the time of the proceeding, merits re-consideration of the final disposition.

The appeal officer designated by the provost will review the written appeal request and determine whether, in the judgment of the appeal officer, the appeal presents an appealable issue that warrants review by the appeal officer. In reviewing an appeal, the appeal officer, at their discretion, may meet with individuals and review information relevant to the basis of the appeal.

In the event of an appeal, outcomes will normally be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the appeal. In the event of an appeal at the end of a semester that affects recording of a course grade, an incomplete grade will be assigned pending the outcome of the appeal process.

Appeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances warrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the student, course instructor, and department head as necessary about the anticipated timeline.

The appeal officer will require that the dean of the student’s college review the case and provide input on the final disposition.

The appeal officer has the authority to accept, vacate or modify the decision as they deem appropriate for resolution of the matter being appealed. The appeal officer may reconvene the initial  Academic Responsibility Panel or remand the matter to a new Academic Responsibility Panel for review.

#### Outcomes

The academic integrity action outcomes defined below comprise a range of official actions that may be imposed during an Academic Review Meeting or Academic Responsibility Panel. One or more of these actions may be imposed in response to a given situation. This list is not comprehensive, as other outcomes may be imposed as appropriate.

Non-compliance with outcomes may result in further action through the Academic Integrity Actions process.

The determination of outcomes will be guided by the following considerations: the interests of the community, the learning and development of the student, the impact of the violation(s), and any mitigating or aggravating circumstances.

#### Outcomes Related to Student Standing

These outcomes clarify the student’s standing with the University. Additional violations of the Academic Integrity policy may result in more severe outcomes including separation from the University.

-   Status Warning: A student may be issued a status warning for a designated period of time. This status may entail specific requirements to be met. When a student is on a status warning they may be subject to suspension or expulsion in the event of further academic integrity action.
-   **Suspension**: A student may be barred from enrollment for a designated period of time. Students who have been suspended are required to absent themselves from the campus (including university housing, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off the campus for the duration of the time specified as outlined in the University Policy on Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal. A student on suspension is not eligible for student employment by the university during the period of suspension.
-   **Drop from Academic Program**: The student is required to sever entirely their connection with the academic program in which they are currently enrolled. Students who have been dropped from an academic program may apply for admission to other academic programs at the university.
-   **Expulsion**: The student is required to sever entirely their connection with the university. Students who have been expelled are required to absent themselves from the campus (including university housing,, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off of the campus permanently. . Students who have been expelled from the university may not apply for admission to other academic programs at the university or participate in any events or activities (including virtual events) sponsored by Carnegie Mellon University, including those for alumni.

**Loss of Privilege**: Students may lose specified privileges, which may include access to facilities, services, and/or the opportunity to participate in university programs or activities.

#### Restorative Outcomes

These outcomes require the student to take action to repair the harm their behavior caused or to utilize university resources to support their continued engagement in the community. Failure to complete these outcomes by the specified deadline may result in additional academic integrity action.

-   **Behavioral Assessments and Recommendations**: The university may require a student to meet with a health care provider and/or a mental health care provider within a specified time frame. If so, the student will be expected to fully participate in any relevant assessment requested by the provider and complete any consequent recommendation(s), such as a treatment plan or a referral to another provider. The student is also expected to provide the appropriate releases to allow the university to confirm compliance with this outcome.
-   **Community Service**: The university may require uncompensated service (a specified number of hours) to the university or an off-campus, non-profit organization as an outcome. The particular assignment of duties must be pre-approved by the process advisor. Students must provide appropriate documentation verifying their completed community service.
-   **Educational/Developmental Assignment**: The university may require a student to complete a project, assignment, or activity to promote the student’s education and development. These assignments are determined by the Academic Responsibility Panel or during an Academic Review Meeting and completion is monitored by the process advisor. Assignments may include but are not limited to: reflection or research paper, development of a presentation, discussion with an individual, apology letter, reading assignment, etc.

#### Withholding a Degree

Because a degree from the university signifies not only successful completion of academic requirements but also compliance with the university’s standards and good standing as a member of the university community, the dean of students or designee may direct that a degree not be certified by the university registrar and therefore not awarded pending the resolution of academic integrity action proceedings, including completion of all outcomes.

#### Academic Integrity Actions Records Retention and Reporting

Records of academic integrity actions proceedings are confidential and are not released without the consent of the current/former student or as otherwise required or authorized by law or court order. With the exceptions as noted below, records of academic integrity actions proceedings are retained for three years after final separation of the student from the university. For purposes of determining final separation from the university, a student must be separated for three continuous years. If a student re-enrolls in any academic program within three years, the calculation of the final separation date will reset.

Consistent with the Student Privacy Rights Policy, for purposes of academic integrity actions record checks,  information from these records is only provided, with appropriate authorization as necessary, for three years after final separation from the university (as defined above) provided the student has fulfilled all obligations to the university.

The file may be maintained indefinitely and reported longer than three years after the student separates from the university if a student has not fulfilled all obligations or has not resolved a pending Academic Integrity violation.

Records of academic integrity actions proceedings resulting in the permanent separation of a student from the university (e.g., expulsion) will be maintained and reported indefinitely.Case-specific questions regarding timeframes for student conduct record retention and reporting can be directed to the [Office of Community](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/about-ocsi/contact-us/index.html) Responsibility.
