Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar complies with common University policies unless otherwise noted. The curriculum requirements for the Biological Sciences, Business Administration, Computer Science, and Information Systems majors are set by the respective departments of the Mellon College of Science, Tepper School of Business, the School of Computer Science, and the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy on the main campus.  At the university level, the same academic standards, policies, and actions apply to all programs at CMU-Q as at the Pittsburgh campus.

**Academic Actions**

Academic Actions are a part of a process designed to help students who are not meeting standards for satisfactory academic progress be successful. Students will be informed by a letter from the Area Head for their academic major if an academic action has been taken in their regard. The letter will identify individuals and resources that can help them address barriers to their success.  Academic Actions may be taken for students carrying either a full-time course load (defined as 36 or more units) or a part-time course load (defined as fewer than 36 units). A student on an academic action cannot overload, study abroad, or take independent studies.

**Minimum Standards**

Academic Actions will be taken when students fail to meet the following standards:

-   enrollment in 36 or more units (unless a drop-below full-time status has been approved by the Senior Associate Dean for Education with a note indicating that the drop will not be subject to academic action)
-   a semester QPA of at least 2.0
-   a cumulative QPA, or post-first-year cumulative QPA if higher, of at least 2.0, and
-   making satisfactory progress towards their degree according to the standards set by their declared major. **(See Below)**

**Making Satisfactory Progress towards your degree:**

For Business Administration, Biological Science and Information Systems, adequate progress towards graduation means that students are successfully completing at least 80% of attempted units in a semester (calculated using total units carried when grades are entered). Grades of N, W, or R grade do not count as completed units.

For Computer Science students should have completed the following courses by the end of the specified semesters:

First-Year Spring: 21-127, 15-112

Sophomore Spring: 15-122

Junior Fall: 15-150, 15-213

Junior Spring: 15-210, 15-251

For the purposes of calculating QPAs, all incomplete grades will be treated by their default grade until resolved. Hence, a Incomplete with a default grade of “R” would impact academic progress and QPA calculations. Students should consult with their academic advisor or the Director of Student Academic Success to understand the standards for satisfactory progress set by their respective major.

 **Academic Warning**

Students will be placed on Academic Warning status if their record at the end of a semester fails to meet the minimum standards described above. Students will return to good academic standing after one semester on Academic Warning if they then meet the minimum standards specified above.

**Continued Academic Warning**

If a student on Academic Warning earns a semester QPA above 2.0 but their cumulative QPA and post-first-year cumulative QPA are still below 2.0, they will be placed on Continued Academic Warning status. A student will also be placed on Continued Academic Warning status, if they earn a semester QPA above 2.0 but have not yet satisfied the conditions for satisfactory progress in their major because of course scheduling constraints. Students who are taking 36 or more units, meeting their major’s standards for satisfactory progress, and earning a semester QPA above 2.0 may continue on Continued Academic Warning until their cumulative QPA or post-first-year cumulative QPA is above 2.0.

**Suspension**

A student who fails to meet the minimum standards described above or those for Continued Academic Warning at the end of the Academic Warning semester will be placed on Academic Suspension.

Suspension is typically for a minimum of one year. While on academic suspension, students are considered to be on a mandatory “leave of absence” and are governed by College and University policies concerning leaves of absence. Per university policy, students on suspension may not attend classes, live in university-related housing, or have on-campus employment unless they receive an exception from the Senior Associate Dean for Education.

**Drop**

A student who fails to meet the minimum standards at the end of a semester on Final Academic Warning is subject to a Drop action. A Drop action is a permanent severance; the student is required to follow University procedures for departing from campus and may not enroll again in the future.

The typical progression of academic actions is Academic Warning, Suspension, then Drop.
