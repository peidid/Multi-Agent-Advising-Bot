###### _(if you are looking for the final exam schedule, please go [here](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/final-exams/)._ 

This page describes the  Dos and Don’ts about in-term and final exams. You are advised to also check the [CMU policies](http://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/examination-policies.html) for a full description.

Please note that the following guidelines apply to course sections offered by CMUQ. For instructions regarding courses offered by CMU Pittsburgh and that you may be taking remotely, please refer to the [CMU policies](http://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/examination-policies.html).

**I.  In-term Examinations (adapted for Qatar)**

– All in-term examinations should be given during the regularly scheduled class time. However, if the exam requires additional time to complete, then examinations may be administered outside of regularly scheduled class time.

– No examinations given outside of class time (excluding make ups and self-scheduled examinations) shall be administered on a Thursday after 4:30 pm (Qatar Time), or at any time Friday or Saturday.

– The instructor administering an exam (or another required class event) that falls outside class time must make any and all reasonable accommodations to provide an alternative time to students who have conflicts with the proposed time period, including those conflicts due to activities, meetings, other classes, etc. (provided that the instructor is notified of such conflict in a timely manner).

– No student shall be required to take more than two full-period in-class or out-of-class examinations on the same day. It is the responsibility of the student to notify their instructor in a timely manner of their circumstance so that appropriate accommodations can be made.

**II. Final Exams**

The full policy can be found here [http://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/examination-policies.html](http://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/examination-policies.html)

Please note the following:

1- Reading days, the weekend preceding examination days, and weekends during an examination period shall not be used for examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to take a self-scheduled examination during this time.

Designated make-up examinations days shall never be used for examination purposes of any kind, unless approved by Mariamma Thomas in support of approved accommodations.

2- Non-comprehensive final examinations or final projects (but not both) are allowed during the final examination period only in courses that do not give a final comprehensive examination.

3- In appreciation of the time required to prepare for final examinations, no other examinations, portfolio reviews, critiques or juries shall be scheduled for the last class day of a course with a final examination.

4- Note on Final exams conflicts for the students:

Please take note of the policy hereby [http://www.cmu.edu/es/faculty/exams.html](http://www.cmu.edu/es/faculty/exams.html)   in order to resolve students’ conflicts on final exam. By design, we will have a few conflicts, and it is inevitable. So instructors should expect that students will approach them for resolution of conflicts.

**In short**, it is the student’s responsibility to identify the conflict and to address it with instructors early on. Instructors have an obligation to accommodate a final exam conflict. If no agreement is found, the student will approach first their Advisor, and next the Senior Associate Dean for Education for assistance in resolving the conflict.

5- Note on Final exams proctoring through the ARC:

Faculty, please provide the ARC director (Mariamma Thomas) with ample advance notice if you need any assistance proctoring your final exams.

Undergraduate Course Assistants are not permitted to proctor final exams. Their jobs end on the last day of classes.

Please request the ARC’s policy on proctoring exams.

**III. Unforeseeable Conflicts with a Final Exam**

Students: please recall that your professors will use incompletes in exceptional circumstances only. Your professors will make the determination of the suitability of an incomplete grade after seeking verification through (1) your academic advisor, (2) the Senior Associate Dean for Education, and/or (3) Health and Wellness (Student Affairs).

Excerpt from CMU’s policy:  Unforeseeable Conflicts

In exceptional circumstances, a student may encounter a medical, personal or family emergency that unexpectedly interferes with his/her ability to participate in a scheduled final examination.  When encountering such a situation, the student should contact the instructor as soon as is reasonably possible, and ideally before the final examination has been administered.  The student’s academic advisor, academic associate dean and/or student affairs liaison may serve as both advocate for the student and point of verification for the instructor.   After reviewing the matter, should an accommodation be granted by the instructor, the instructor may elect to institute one of several options, including:  rescheduling the exam for later in the final examination period; **assigning an “I” incomplete grade** until a make-up exam can be administered in the following semester; or utilizing another method for resolving missed exams that has been outlined in the course syllabus.

**IV- Finally,** 

Concerns related to final examination, complaints about violations of the final examination policy or alterations of the final examination schedule should be directed to the Senior Associate Dean for Education.
