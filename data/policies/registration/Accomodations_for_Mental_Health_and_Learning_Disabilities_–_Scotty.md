Students diagnosed with a documented mental health disability such as a major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, eating disorder, bipolar disorder etc., can contact the CaPS-Q office to explore the possibility of receiving academic accommodations in support of their disability related needs. Students with a documented learning disability can also contact the CaPS-Q office to request academic accommodations. The CaPS-Q office will send the documentation provided by the student, to the Office of Disability Resources (ODR) in Pittsburgh for further consideration and determination of academic accommodations.

Students experiencing symptoms of a mental illness or a specific learning disorder which hasn’t been diagnosed but is having a negative impact on their school performance, can also request for a comprehensive psychological assessment. The results of that assessment (in case of a diagnosable condition) will provide basis for the academic accommodations. Upon student’s permission and request, the results of the assessment will be shared with the Office of Disability Resources (ODR) in Pittsburgh for further consideration and determination of the needed academic accommodations.
