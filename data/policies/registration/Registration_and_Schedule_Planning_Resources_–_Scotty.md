Below you find list of all of the resources that you will need in order to build a healthy course schedule.   During each semester,  you’ll be spending 14 weeks in your courses and approximately 9-12 hours per week per course.  It’s important that you use the resources available to create a schedule that will enable you to use your time wisely, make progress toward your degree, and grow academically.

Many of the resources below reference sending forms to the HUB for processing. For CMU-Q students and EC cross-registered students, all forms and inquiries should be directed to either your academic advisor or to [jfn](mailto:qatareducationform@andrew.cmu.edu)[@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:jfn@andrew.cmu.edu)

**Schedule Changes**

All schedule changes are governed by the dates and deadlines in the [Academic Calendar](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-calendar-2/). It is the student’s responsibility to know the dates and deadlines and ensure that all forms are submitted before the deadline to ensure proper processing and approval.

**Course Conflict Resolution**:  If you would like to take two courses that have conflicting times, you must first get written (email) permission to register for the courses from the instructors that have overlapping courses.  You must then provide those email permissions  to [Jarrin Nevel](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/schedule-planning-resources/jfn@andrew.cmu.edu),  [jfn@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:jfn@andrew.cmu.edu) for registration.

If you find that after checking all of the resources that you still have some unanswered questions, never hesitate to contact your [advisor](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-services/academic-advising/) or a course [instructor](https://www.qatar.cmu.edu/directory/) for more information.
