# Certificates

Certificates are designed to provide specialized knowledge and skills in a specific field or topic. These programs require fewer courses than minors, typically 4 courses (33-36 units minimum) including a capstone or ePortfolio course. Unlike minors, certificate programs may not cover a broad range of topics within a discipline; instead, they offer a targeted and practical focus. Certificate programs are often tailored to meet the demands of specific industries and provide students with a credential indicating their expertise in a particular area.

The choice between a minor and a certificate depends on a student’s goals, interests, and the level of expertise they wish to achieve in a particular field. Note that for majors that require a minor or concentration, a certificate will not satisfy the requirement. If in doubt, please discuss with your academic advisor.
