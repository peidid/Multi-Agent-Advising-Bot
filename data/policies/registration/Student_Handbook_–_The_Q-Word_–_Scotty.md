The Q-Word (Student Handbook) contains information and resources to help you create your Carnegie Mellon experience and embrace your role as a valued member of our university. At Carnegie Mellon, our ambition is that all students will reach their highest potential in the areas of intellectual and artistic pursuits, personal well-being, professional development, leadership, and contribution to the larger community.

Community membership affords many privileges and likewise responsibilities as we all uphold the standards of our university. To ensure you are knowledgeable of the university’s expectations and the process that will be followed if standards are not met, this handbook articulates the rights and responsibilities afforded to and expected of each member of our community.

We ask that you embrace our individual and collective responsibilities to uphold the standards of our community. **As a student at Carnegie Mellon, and member of our community, you must familiarize yourself with and abide by these expectations**.

We hope you will take advantage of this handbook to support your Carnegie Mellon experience.
