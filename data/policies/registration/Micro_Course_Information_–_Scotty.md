# Micro Course Information

## **Micro Courses at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar**

Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar (CMU-Q) offers an innovative learning experience through **Micro Courses**—a unique initiative that connects the expertise of our main campus faculty with the dynamic student community in Doha. These immersive, short-format courses span a wide range of disciplines, bringing world-class instruction to Qatar in an exciting, flexible format.

## **What Makes Micro Courses Special?**

Micro Courses are designed to deliver intensive, high-impact learning in just 4-6 weeks, offering students the opportunity to earn 3 units in a fast-paced yet engaging environment. Each course blends the best of both worlds:

-   In-Person Engagement – Pittsburgh faculty travel to Doha to teach face-to-face, fostering rich discussions and mentorship.
-   Live Virtual Learning – Interactive Zoom sessions provide flexibility and real-time collaboration across campuses.

## **Beyond the Classroom: A Bridge Between Campuses**

More than just condensed coursework, Micro Courses serve as a catalyst for intellectual exploration and global connections. They allow students to:  
![✅](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/svg/2705.svg) Expand their academic horizons by exploring topics not typically offered in Doha.  
![✅](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/svg/2705.svg) Engage with leading faculty from CMU’s main campus in an intimate, high-energy learning environment.  
![✅](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/svg/2705.svg) Strengthen ties between the Qatar and Pittsburgh campuses, building meaningful academic and professional networks.

## **Enrollment & Academic Policies**

-   Students can explore how Micro Courses fit into their degree plans using the [**Stellic Academic Audit**.](https://www.cmu.edu/es/stellic/index.html)
-   Due to their unique schedule, students have until the end of the first week of class to:  -   Elect to audit
      -   Choose pass/fail grading
      -   Drop the course
    
-   All requests must be sent to **Jarrin Nevel (jfn@andrew.cmu.edu)** before the deadline.

## **Why Take a Micro Course?**

-   Learn from world-class faculty without leaving Doha.
-   Gain specialized knowledge in a short, impactful timeframe.
-   Connect with a global academic network and broaden your perspectives.

Don’t miss this opportunity to expand your learning, challenge yourself, and be part of an exciting academic exchange between campuses. Sign up for a Micro Course and and immerse yourself in new academic experiences!

**Notes:**

-   Students may register for only one micro or more than one. If you plan to enroll in multiple micro courses, please review the class meeting dates carefully to ensure there is no, or minimal, scheduling overlap.
-   Those wishing to take _all 3 of the 82-xxx micro courses in S25,_ to earn 9 units for the justice/injustice category of Gen Ed in Dietrich College, should register for course **82-299** to ensure they are enrolled in the 9 unit version.
-   Class meeting times occur in the evenings, after regular classes have finished. During Ramadan, class times will be adjusted to begin after Maghrib prayer and Iftar.
-   To foster an engaging and interactive learning environment, students are **_expected_** to have their cameras on during remote classes. This ensures active participation and supports a sense of community in the virtual classroom. Failure to have your camera on for the duration of class may result in being marked absent unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor. If you experience technical issues or have privacy concerns, please communicate with your professor in advance to discuss accommodations.
