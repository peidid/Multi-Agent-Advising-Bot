# Plan Course Schedule

## The University Registrar's Office collects course offerings from our academic departments to create the [Schedule of Classes (SOC)](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/soc/index.html) each semester. Students may use the Plan Course Schedule feature in [Student Information Online (SIO)](https://s3.as.cmu.edu/sio/index.html) to plan future schedules once the SOC is published. Students can also use [Stellic Degree Audit](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/stellic/index.html) to plan their schedules and track their progress toward earning their degree.

# Planning Your Schedule

## Step 1: Browse the SOC

Published before each semester begins, the [Schedule of Classes (SOC)](https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet) displays the courses available in any given semester, listing courses, titles, meeting times, classroom assignments and instructor information. The SOC will also display course planning information such as course reservations and pre-requisites or co-requisites. 

## Step 2: Check Your Progress with Stellic

The [Stellic Degree Audit Application](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/stellic/index.html) is a student-driven, collaborative academic planning tool that employs the university’s undergraduate catalog and degree requirements to assist students with schedule planning and staying on-track to graduate. Stellic can help you track your progress toward earning your degree, displays co-requisites and pre-requisites, and more. 

## Step 3: Plan Course Schedule in SIO

In addition to Stellic, you can use the _Plan Course Schedule_ feature in [Student Information Online (SIO)](https://s3.as.cmu.edu/sio/index.html) to plan your schedule for the upcoming semester. SIO also allows you to send more than one planned schedule to your advisor for feedback and suggestions.

## Step 4: Register for Courses in SIO

Once registration week begins, you will register for courses within SIO. Information about registration start times and a step-by-step guide to the registration process are available on the [Registration Steps](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/steps/index.html) webpage.
