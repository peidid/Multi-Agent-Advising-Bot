**Enrollment Statuses**

The enrollment status determines your current enrollment as well as your future enrollment eligibility.

-   **Eligible to Enroll**: The student is eligible for enrollment and able to register for classes.
-   **Conditionally Enrolled**: The student is registered, actively attending classes but has a remaining student account balance.
-   **Enrolled**: Student is registered, actively attending classes and the student account balance is paid in full.
-   **Withdraw/Administratively**: The student did not register for classes for that semester after becoming eligible and did not submit a leave of absence or withdrawal form.
-   **Suspension/Administrative**: The student has a student account balance and will not be permitted to register until the balance is resolved or a payment arrangement is made.
-   **Suspension/Academic**: Student has been suspended from the university due to academic performance. 
-   **Administrative Suspension/Administrative Restriction**: The student has an outstanding student account balance **and** an administrative restriction on their return to the university (eg. financial account balance + leave of absence,  financial account balance + academic suspension)

**Registration Holds**

While a student may be academically and financially eligible to enroll, they may have a registration hold placed on the account. Once a hold is placed on the student’s record they will be unable to register for classes until the hold is resolved.

**Types of Registration Holds**
