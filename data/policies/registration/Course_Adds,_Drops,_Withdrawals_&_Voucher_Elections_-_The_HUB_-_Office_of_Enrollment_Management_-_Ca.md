# Course Changes: Add, Drop, Withdrawal & Voucher Election

Listed below is a timeline and instructions for making course changes, including adds, drops, withdrawals and pass/no pass (P/NP) elections, as well as instructions for using vouchers to either drop a course or elect to take a course as pass/no pass after the deadlines.

It is expected that students who are full-time after the add period retain full-time status (36 units) unless there are extenuating circumstances. In order to drop below full-time, students should meet with their advisor and associate dean. Students are not allowed to use vouchers to drop below full-time status.

Add, drop, withdrawal and pass/no pass election deadlines may be found on the official [Academic Calendar](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html).

### Timeline/Process Exceptions:

-   Students with a pending or documented academic integrity violation may not drop the course or change the course to P/NP, including the use of a voucher. 
-   Doctoral course-sections follow a separate [Academic Calendar](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html).
-   Mini and micro course deadlines differ from regular semester deadlines (see [Academic Calendar](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html) for dates).
-   "W" grades are not assigned to graduate students in the colleges of CFA, DC, SCS and CMU/ETC department.
-   Graduate students in CIT and SCS who make pass/no pass elections will receive "S" grades instead of "P" grades if the course is passed; "S" grades are the equivalent of "P" grades and vice versa. 
-   Doctoral students, visiting/non-degree students, and certificate students do not receive vouchers and do not participate in the voucher process.

# Voucher Process

The voucher process was implemented to permit a limited number of course drops and pass/no pass elections after the deadlines. 

The policies for using vouchers are as follows:

-   Vouchers may be used to either make pass/no pass elections after the Pass/Fail Grade Option Deadline has passed **or** to drop courses after the Course Drop Deadline has passed.
-   Vouchers are not intended to be used for exceptional or extenuating circumstances; they cannot be used to drop below full-time status (36 units); and they cannot be used for courses from which a student has already withdrawn.  -   Undergraduate students are permitted three vouchers over the course of their undergraduate career and may use only **one voucher per semester** (including summer).
      -   Master’s students are permitted one voucher per 12 months of study (beginning with the month they started) and may use only **one voucher per semester** (including summer).
      -   Doctoral students, visiting/non-degree students, and certificate students do not receive vouchers and do not participate in the voucher process.
    
-   Eligible students may elect to use a voucher up to and including the last day of classes each semester.
-   A voucher (either PNP or drop) may not be used once a course withdrawal (W grade) has been assigned.
-   Voucher elections, once confirmed by the student, are irreversible.

### Voucher Instructions:

1.  A student wishing to use a voucher to drop a course or switch to pass/no pass after the deadlines must first consult with their **primary** academic advisor. 
    
2.  After the consultation, the primary academic advisor will enter the voucher into the Student Services Suite (S3), indicating that it will be used for either a course drop or a pass/no pass election.
    
3.  The student will receive an email notification and must confirm that they have made a voucher election within **24 hours**.
4.  **Students should contact their primary academic advisors about using a voucher no later than 12:00 p.m., on the day prior to the last day of classes**. View the [Academic Calendar](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html) for dates and deadlines.

### A Specific example:
some students are considering droping 15-110 due to grade concern and other reason, and below is the IS area head's reply:
At this point, students are past the drop deadline (end of 6th week of classes) and the withdraw deadline (end of 10th week)  for the semester. There are two options to avoid receiving a grade in 15-110 at this point:
1) use a voucher, in which case the course is treated as if they had dropped it and the units are no longer counted towards the required 36 units or the number of attempted units used to compute academic action status

2) submit the late drop petition that Jarrin shared -- if approved, the course will appear on the student's transcript with a grade of W. This means that the units count towards units attempted for the purpose of full-time status and determining academic actions.

If #1 (voucher) does not take them below 36 units, this is the best option.

If it takes them below 36 units, then #2 is the only option and that will require my approval as well as yours. Generally, I will not approve this as the university's position, is that "Course withdrawals after the deadline are not permitted. Students should discuss options with their academic advisor. " If students want to withdraw from a course, then they really need to make that decision prior to the end of the 10th week of classes. If there is an exceptional circumstance, I will consider it but the deadlines exist for a reason.

This example will help to illustrate the use of vocher.
