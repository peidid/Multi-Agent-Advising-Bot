## Financial Grant Refund

## What is a financial grant Refund?

Once your financial grant has been applied to your student account, you may be eligible for a financial grant refund. A financial grant refund is available to you if your financial grant has paid your total CMUQ direct billable expenses and a credit remains on your account. Financial grant must be posted to the student’s account in order for a credit to exist and for a refund to be processed.

## How do I receive my financial grant Refund?

Financial grant refunds are sent via direct deposit. Please allow 2-3 business days for direct deposit to be credited to your personal Qatar bank account. To sign up for direct deposit, please register your Qatar bank account in SIO following these simple steps:

1.  Log in to SIO using your Andrew ID and password
2.  Select ‘Bank Account List’ under the ‘Finances’ tab
3.  Select ‘+ add account,’ and in the ‘Account Location’ dropdown select ‘My bank is  
    not in the U.S.’
4.  Enter the required information in the remaining fields and check the box next to  
    ‘Refund account’
