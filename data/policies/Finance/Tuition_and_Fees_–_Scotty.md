Undergraduate tuition and fees are the same on the Qatar campus as they are on the Pittsburgh campus. There is one exception: students at the Qatar campus pay a book fee of $150 for each semester that they are enrolled full-time (taking 36 units or more). When students are registered part-time, the book fee is $30 per course taken.

For more information and for the actual tuition and fee rates, see: [Tuition and fees](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TUITION-AND-FEES-2025-2026.pdf).
