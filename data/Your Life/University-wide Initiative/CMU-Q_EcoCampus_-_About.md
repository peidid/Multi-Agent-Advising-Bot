# CMU-Q EcoCampus - About

What is EcoCampus?

EcoCampus is a dynamic initiative designed to bring the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to life at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar (CMU-Q). Rooted in the globally recognized framework of the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE), this program fosters sustainability across the university community.

As one of the world’s largest environmental education organizations, FEE boasts over 100 member organizations in 81 countries. At CMU-Q, the initiative is closely aligned with FEE's national operator, the Earthna Center for a Sustainable Future. Established by Qatar Foundation (QF), Earthna is a non-profit policy research and advocacy center dedicated to driving environmental, social, and economic sustainability for long-term prosperity.

Through EcoCampus, students are empowered to champion sustainable change, raise awareness among their peers, and enhance operational efficiency across the university. This program not only instills leadership in sustainability but also contributes to creating a more resilient and eco-conscious campus community.

Green Flag Award

On November 21, 2024 CMU-Q was awarded the Green Flag Award. CMU-Q is the first higher education institution in the MENA region to be recognized for their commitment to sustainability. Sustainability is an ongoing effort that requires the entire campus engagement, from operations, education and research. Every two years CMU-Q will be reassessed for the Green Flag and we are committed to continuous improvement.

Steering Committee

EcoCampus activities, audits, and programs are organized by students, staff and faculty who volunteer their time to ensure EcoCampus runs smoothly. Projects are realized and the entire community can take part. The Steering Committee also collects documentation and prepare reports for CMU-Q's audit for maintaining the Green Flag Status.
