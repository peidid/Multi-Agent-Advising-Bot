**CMU-Q Karak Konnections**

Karak Konnections is a new weekly program that aims to strengthen 1 on 1 connections within our CMUQ community outside of our professional or academic relationships. Every week, you can sign up to participate and be matched with a student, staff, or faculty member to have a quick cup of virtual karak with.

#### How it works

2.  You’ll receive an email by Monday mornings with your connection
3.  It’s up to you or your Karak Konnection to arrange when you meet
4.  Take a break and have a cup of karak with a new or old connection
