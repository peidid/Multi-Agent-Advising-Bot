The digital signs in the CMU-Q building are an excellent way to advertise your event. Our office manages and maintains the content on this service. To [**upload artwork to be included on the screens**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vrTRuLB8Hv3rCZOunQPtO85LdI_bx-4EJuNi2ohicgU/edit), please ensure that you upload a JPEG with the correct specifications: **full HD or 1920 x 1080 pixels** (width x height).

###### **Tips for Designing Posters**

To make the biggest impact with your digital poster, keep these tips in mind:

1.  Keep your text to a minimum. Only communicate the essentials; what, where, when, who. You should be able to read all of the information in your poster in 8 seconds.
2.  Ensure your text is visible. Font sizes below 20 are hard to read on digital signage.
3.  Do not include too many colors: simple is better to make poster readable.
4.   Make sure there is a good contrast between the text color and the background color.
