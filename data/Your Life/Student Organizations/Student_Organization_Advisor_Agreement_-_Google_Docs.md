##STUDENT ORGANIZATION ADVISOR AGREEMENT			       -

OVERVIEW
An Advisor is an essential part of a successful student organization, and an invaluable resource to help students identify and achieve their goals. Advisors provide a balance between support and challenge, helping students to explore areas outside their comfort zone, and encouraging students to delve deeper into opportunities to enhance the impact of their work. The Advisor role is both personal and professional in nature, allowing faculty and staff with a strong background in a specific interest area to support student groups engaging with related activities and discussions.

The Student Majlis at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar provides discretionary funding for student organizations that are recognized through a formal application process once per semester. As part of the registration process, the leadership team of each club has the opportunity to request a faculty/staff advisor to work with them throughout the semester.

The duration of the advisor role is flexible according to the needs of the advisor and the student group. In the event that an advisor can no longer fulfill their duties, the student group may identify a new advisor by the beginning of the following semester.

When new student organizations are recognized at the beginning of each semester, the Student Majlis and the Coordinator of Student Activities provide mandatory training to equip new club leaders with skills and resources to run a student organization, organize activities, manage budget and expenses, and realize the organization’s mission. The advisor’s role is to support the student group as they put these skills into practice.

Advisors complement the administrative and financial support provided by the Student Majlis and Coordinator of Student Activities, allowing student organizations to benefit from the expertise and resources of an experienced mentor in their chosen interest area. Advisors have the opportunity to connect with students outside the classroom or administrative work, building a rapport that transcends the formal instructor-learner relationship, nurturing students as they explore personal and professional growth.

To register an advisor for an officially recognized student organization, both the advisor and the student organization leaders should read through and discuss the contents of this document. If both parties are in agreement and wish to move forward with confirming the advising relationship, please sign the agreement section, and attach a scanned copy of this form to the student organization application.

ADVISOR ELIGIBILITY
All faculty and staff members at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar are eligible to serve as advisors to a student club.
Being mindful of conflict of interest, the Coordinator of Student Activities will not serve as advisor to any particular student organization other than the Student Majlis.
Advisors should be open to communication with their supervisor about expectations in taking on the advisor role.
Family members of CMU-Q community members, as well as members of the local community are welcome to contribute their experience and expertise to help clubs and organizations at the group’s invitation. Such individuals cannot be confirmed as official advisors, and can only serve in a secondary capacity to the group’s official staff or faculty advisor.

ADVISOR BOUNDARIES AND GUIDELINES
It is not encouraged for a single individual to serve as the advisor to more than two different student organizations at a time.
Advisors are not “members” of the student organization they advise. Therefore, advisors may not vote, conduct business, or create, modify, or cancel any event planned by the student organization.
Advisors may not contact the Student Majlis on behalf of the student organization in response to the Student Majlis’s decision on the organization’s recognition and budget standing. Instead, advisors are encouraged to help student organization leaders to develop negotiation skills, gather supporting materials, and advocate for themselves. Meanwhile, advisors are welcome to contact the advisor of Student Majlis (Coordinator of Student Activities) when they have significant concerns about the organization’s trajectory or its interaction with the Student Majlis.
Advisors are not authorized to request or utilize funding provided by the Student Majlis or Student Affairs.
Inversely, student organizations are not authorized to request advisors to contribute departmental funds to events without discussing with the Coordinator of Student Activities.
In any case, student organizations are strictly prohibited from misleading advisors to contribute personal funds to cover expenses. The Student Majlis has budget reserves and procedures for eligible student organizations to request for additional funding.
To facilitate timely communication of student organization status and operations, advisors will be copied on emails for student organization recognition, event approval, and significant concerns.

ADVISOR SELECTION
Student organizations motivated to work with an advisor are encouraged to identify a staff or faculty member interested in serving as an advisor for their group. The selection of an advisor is at the discretion of the students, but Student Affairs and the Student Majlis may be able to make helpful recommendations when requested.

At the beginning of the Fall semester, the Student Majlis will host a Club Fair for students, staff, and faculty to learn more about each group’s interests and activities. The Club Fair can be an opportune time for connections to be made between students and interested staff/faculty.

ADVISOR CHANGE
Student organizations may change their advisor by providing email notification to the Student Majlis and the Coordinator of Student Activities. If an advisor needs to withdraw from a position, they should contact the group’s leaders and explain the situation. The advisor may not pass off their responsibilities to another staff or faculty member without a prior conversation with the group. In the event an advisor is changed, the advisor should support the transition process by providing information and sharing resources for the new advisor.

Long ­term continuity between a student group and its advisor, however, can be in the best interests of both parties. If a relationship becomes strained or any other circumstance should arise, students and advisors are encouraged to seek assistance from Student Affairs.

AGREEMENT
By signing this agreement, the advisor and leaders of the student organization agree to establish a constructive and positive relationship built on mutual best interest and respect. The advisor and student leaders agree to establish and maintain open communication, especially with regard to each party’s duties and ongoing expectations of each other as they relate to the roles described in this document.
