As of Fall 2025 semester, we will have three all-student mailing lists. When sending a message to students, consider which is most appropriate for the content of your message and note that  \[TAGS\] will be automatically added to the subject line depending on the list you choose.

The lists are:

-   [all-students-official@lists.qatar.cmu.edu](mailto:all-students-official@lists.qatar.cmu.edu) – adds the \[OFFICIAL\] tag to the subject  -   Example topics: notifications about EC Gate Closures or Phishing attacks, etc. 
      -   Example subject line: \[OFFICIAL\] Phishing attack: attempt to steal your password
      -   This list is not for student use, it is for official communication from the Dean’s office
    
-   [all-students-academic@lists.qatar.cmu.edu](mailto:all-students-academic@lists.qatar.cmu.edu) – adds the \[ACADEMIC\] tag to the subject  -   Example topics: Notifications about registration or academic calendar deadlines, etc.
      -   Example subject line: \[ACADEMIC\] Spring 2025 Registration starts Tuesday
      -   All emails will be vetted through the Education Office to ensure appropriateness
    
-   [all-students-campus-events-and-activities@lists.qatar.cmu.edu](mailto:all-students-campus-events-and-activities@lists.qatar.cmu.edu) – adds the \[EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES\] tag to the subject  -   Example topics: Notifications about student club fairs, QF events or leadership opportunities, etc.  
      -   Example subject line: \[EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES\] Thursday Majlis: Welcome Back Fun
      -   This list is appropriate for all student club events.

The [all-students-community-bulletin-board@lists.qatar.cmu.edu](mailto:all-students-community-bulletin-board@lists.qatar.cmu.edu) has now been retired and messages to this list will not be delivered to the community. If you want to advertise to faculty and staff for your events please use the Digital Signage or the events-and-activities D-List. The faculty/staff d-lists are not for student use.

**Staff and Faculty**, if you would like to learn more about our student events happening on campus, consult the [Events Calendar (qatar-event-planning)](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=qatar-event-planning%40andrew.cmu.edu&ctz=Asia%2FQatar). If you would like to be added to the [all-students-campus-events-and-activities@lists.qatar.cmu.edu](mailto:all-students-campus-events-and-activities@lists.qatar.cmu.edu), please email [helpcenter@qatar.cmu.edu](mailto:helpcenter@qatar.cmu.edu) .

**Students**, as a reminder, all lists are moderated and messages are reviewed to ensure that the content is appropriate for each list. We ask that you limit notifications to once per event and consult the [Events Calendar (qatar-event-planning)](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=qatar-event-planning%40andrew.cmu.edu&ctz=Asia%2FQatar) regularly. Messages are released approximately on the following schedule:

-   Weekdays: once early morning 
-   Weekends and Holidays: infrequently
