### Subscribe to the CMUQ-Event-Calendar

To check the availability of your event dates, look at the shared Google event calendar (CMUQ-Event-Calendar). If this is your first time accessing the calendar, scroll to the bottom left sidebar of your Google calendar.

-   In the Other calendars list on the left, click the + to add a new calendar
-   Select “Subscribe to calendar”
-   In the “Add calendar” edit box, type “CMUQ-Event-Calendar”
-   Select “CMUQ-Event-Calendar”
-   Exit “Settings” page by clicking on the back arrow in the top left corner
-   The “CMUQ-Event-Calendar” calendar should show up under “Other calendar” section.

When this calendar is checked, you will see all of the scheduled events and their locations. Ensure that your time and location are available, and there are not too many competing events at that time.

### **1\. Event Planning and Advisor Involvement**

For student clubs, before submitting an [**Event Form**](https://forms.qatar.cmu.edu/internal-forms/facilities-management/event-registration-and-support-request/), please review your event plan with your **club advisor**. Advisors can help ensure your form is complete and offer guidance on event planning before submission.

L**ate event requests may not be approved** as the Events Team will have limited capacity to accommodate late submissions. Please plan ahead and give sufficient notice: 

-   **Unsupported event** (i.e. only needing classroom or open space)  requires a **Register an Unsupported Event Form** at least **5 business days’ notice** (these require no additional needs and require use of open classroom or building space). 
-   **Supported Events Forms** (i.e. need for couches, microphones/AV needs, chairs, tables, whiteboard, etc.) require a two step process:  (1) **Reserve a date for a supported event** and (2) **Request support for an approved event.** These typically need 4-6 weeks notice and we encourage you to submit both at the same time.

**Please Note**:  requests involving external vendors (i.e guest speakers, catering, food trucks, etc.) may require **up to 3 weeks for contracts approval for either a Supported or Unsupported event.** 

### **2\. Completing the Event Form Correctly**

Incomplete forms delay processing and event approval. When filling out the **Event Form**, make sure to:

-   Provide **complete information** about your event, including contact details and setup needs.
-   Clearly indicate what kind of **support** your event requires (Facilities, IT, MPR, catering, etc.).
-   Specify **all items** being requested (including detailed or itemized Deliveroo orders).
-   Respond promptly to follow-up emails from Meredith or Dina for clarifications.

If there are **any changes** to approved events (date, setup, supplies, etc.), please inform **Meredith ([meredit2@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:meredit2@andrew.cmu.edu))** directly no later than 48 hours before your event. Do **not reach out individually** to Facilities, IT, or other offices.

### **3\. Budget and Purchase Plans**

All purchasing and payment requests must go through the **Event Form process.**

Student Affairs manages the payments for clubs, and the priority is to directly cover costs rather than allowing exceptions for student reimbursements. If there is a true need for students to self-pay, then all reimbursement requests must receive written approval from Student Affairs prior.

**For on-campus payments, Deliveroo** is the preferred method of on-campus delivery options for the university during the lunch hour or for evening events. In your events form you can request that Student Affairs places a Deliveroo order by:

-   Include a **fully itemized list** of items in the Event Form under Budget and Purchase Plans.  -   Vendor name
      -   Exact food item name (as shown on Delivroo)
      -   Quantity of each food item
      -   Delivery pick-up person contact information (name, email, and phone number) – please only include **one person**’s contact information.
    
-   Make sure the appointed Delivery Pick up Person is available to **collect the order within Deliveroo’s wait time (5 minutes after the delivery person’s arrival)**. Since delivery times are rarely exact, the person assigned to pick up food should be available **at least 30 minutes prior to the event time**.
-   Missed pickups result in wasted funds and may affect future event approvals.

Deliveroo items will be dropped off at the CMU [Basement Level Loading Dock](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y1eNMMNhzqgAAM2X6). 

If a club would like to request a vendor outside of Deliveroo, they must ensure the vendor has a POS payment machine and they are willing to come to campus for delivery and payment. If clubs would like this option, please include this in the Event Form under Budget and Purchase Plans. Please note this is not as flexible as Deliveroo orders as it requires staff presence. 

-   Vendor name
-   Student Club lead contact information (name, email, and phone number)
-   The student club lead will be directly responsible for placing the food order and Student Affairs will coordinate payment 10 min before the event start time.

For **off-campus payments** (i.e. entrance ticket, art/craft or other materials) needed to support your club, please also include a fully itemized list of the items needed in the Events Form.

-   Vendor, Number of items, Cost per Item, and possible website.

For **Services** (i.e. calligraphy, catering, photography, videography, Dhow/space rentals), this process can require multiple approvals from departments and will need either a purchase order (PO) or a University Contract. This can take up to **6 weeks** to order, especially for new vendors or large purchases.

### **4\. Advertising your Event**

Please **follow FM guidelines** when posting event posters and using campus spaces. Posters may not be affixed to the walls of the building and instead should be placed on bulletin boards or Digital Signage. 

### 5\. **Branded Items and CMU Merchandise**

Requests for  **branded designs or items** (such as hoodies, banners, or giveaways) require **at least three weeks’ notice**. If your club needs branded items, please email: [Qatar-Student-Affairs@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:Qatar-Student-Affairs@andrew.cmu.edu) and we will coordinate with relevant departments to support your request.
