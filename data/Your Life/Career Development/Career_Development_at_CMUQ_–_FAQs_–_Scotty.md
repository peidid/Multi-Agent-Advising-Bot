Who do we share the Resume Book with?

We have shared the Resume Book with 50+ employers, from both the private and public sector. They should reach out to you, if you meet their requirements etc.  
Employers have continued to reach out to us, so do ensure you make yourself accessible by phone & email.  

How can I seek employment/internship opportunities?

The easiest place is find opportunities is online.  
  
[Indeed.com](https://qa.indeed.com/) is one of the most highly used jobsites, and despite the times we are in, it has a number of new listings. The site also directs you to country specific pages depending on your preferences. Great if you want to look at multiple locations.   
  
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) continues to lead the way in advertising job roles, so do carry out your search here. It is more than likely that online and remote tech jobs are going to increasingly emerge in the coming months, and few platforms will list as many opportunities as LinkedIn.   
  
Other ways to seek opportunities will be to build and tap into your network.  
Reach out to alumni, reach out to friends and family, and build up your intel on what potential opportunities are out there. Find out what you need, and who in particular you need to reach out and connect with, to make this work for you. Past alumni will tell you how effective this can be.   
  
The hidden job market is always the more difficult to penetrate, but also the most effective. Keep that in mind to keep you motivated. 

What are the resources for career development I can look at?

There are a number of resources available in the [Career Development useful links and resources page](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/life-at-cmu-q/career-development-office/resources/): These include grad school prep, psychometric tests, consulting firm materials, and career exploration tools.

Is Grad School a good option to pursue?

Grad school offers people the chance to further equip themselves and potentially get ahead of the competition. Some global universities have extended their admission deadlines, whereas, some grad school locations such as Germany, Australia, and even the UK, offer January/February starts.   
If you’re considering grad school in any region of the world, check out the Grad School Info page for more useful information and link: https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/life-at-cmu-q/career-development- office/resources/grad-school-info/
