Students will be offered admission without consideration or knowledge of their ability to pay the tuition and related cost of attendance. This principle is known as “need blind admission.”

#### **Financial Aid**

Applications for financial assistance should be directed to Qatar Foundation (QF). For more information, see [http://www.myeducationcity.com/](https://www.qf.org.qa/education/higher-education/financial-aid)

Students can contact QF’s Financial Aid Office (FAO) directly by calling +974 4454 0400 or by emailing [fao@qf.org.qa](mailto:fao@qf.org.qa).

#### **Financial Aid for U.S. Citizens**

Please note that U.S. citizens, and some non-citizens (ex. green card holders) may be eligible for Federal Financial Aid (FAFSA) to support your studies at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar. There are different types of funding within FAFSA, including grants (no repayment) and loans.

We advise all U.S. citizens to apply for FAFSA. For guidance on how to apply, see here: [http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/](http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/)

If you are not a U.S. citizen, but think you might be eligible, please check the information on this site to see if you could be eligible: [http://studentaid.ed.gov/eligibility](http://studentaid.ed.gov/eligibility)

If you are applying for Financial Aid from Qatar Foundation, please understand that you can receive FAFSA funding in addition. The university does provide QF with information regarding students’ FAFSA awards to avoid students receiving more than 100% funding.

Both QF funding and FAFSA will be posted directly to your student account. The amount awarded per year will be posted in 2 installments: one half for fall and one half for spring.

For questions about financial aid, please contact [Sheila Rian](mailto: srian@qatar.cmu.edu) – Enrollment Services Manager.
