#### Student Account Invoices (E-Bills)

Student account invoices (E-Bills) are produced on the last day of each month. Invoices detail all transactions processed in the month, as well as any charges due in the future. Students receive an e-mail notification from the Student Accounts Office when a new E-Bill is ready for viewing on Student Information Online. Payments for amounts due from a monthly E-Bill must be received by the 15th of the next calendar month.

All student account invoices are available to view, print, or download through Student Information Online (SIO). Students can log onto Student Information Online with their Andrew ID and password.

#### Billing Authorizations

Students can also authorize Carnegie Mellon to send a copy of their E-Bill to another individual (parent, spouse, etc.) or other individual bill payer’s e-mail address. Students can do so through Student Information Online on the My Info page. When adding or updating a parent, guardian, spouse, or other person’s information, check the “Receive Invoice” box. After completing the authorization process, designated recipients will receive an e-mail with a PDF attachment of the E-Bill and any related billing messages.

#### Payment Plan

A payment plan gives students the ability to pay amounts due to the University in convenient monthly installments. Students who wish to make use of this option should see Sheila Rian – Enrollment Services Manager – before the start of classes.

#### Refunding

If a student account has a negative balance resulting from an over payment, financial aid, or a reduction of charges, the Student Accounts Office will review the account and issue a refund to your bank account. If you have a negative balance, please contact Sheila Rian- Enrollment Services Manager.
