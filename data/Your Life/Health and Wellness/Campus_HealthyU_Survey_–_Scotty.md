At Carnegie Mellon, the holistic health and well-being of students is our top priority. Since 2013, the university has administered HealthyU, an online survey about students’ health and well-being and related experiences at CMU. The data from this survey has been used to inform decision-making around policies, programs, and initiatives that foster a culture of wellness, resilience, and personal growth.  
CMU is committed to using data to improve our practices while honoring the privacy of our students. This survey is being administered by the University’s Office of Institutional Research and Analysis. All assessment reports and dashboards will describe students’ answers in aggregate groups or as a whole, and will not contain information that could allow someone to identify you.

Please see  **Frequently Asked Questions** below. 

What is HealthyU? 

HealthyU is a university-wide assessment that aims to collect robust and accurate data on the various facets of health and well-being for Carnegie Mellon undergraduate and graduate students. The results will inform a roadmap for decision-making around policies, programs, and initiatives that address the specific needs and challenges faced by our diverse student population. By leveraging the survey data, we will create evidence-based interventions and support services that foster a culture of wellness, resilience, and personal growth.

Who is being asked to participate in the survey? 

Carnegie Mellon undergraduate, masters, and Ph.D. students on the PIttsburgh and Qatar campuses are being asked to participate in the Fall 2025 survey administration.

Why am I being asked to participate in this survey? 

As an undergraduate or graduate student at the Pittsburgh and Qatar campuses, CMU leadership is asking for your participation to gather comprehensive and accurate data to:   
  
\-Better understand Carnegie Mellon students’ health and well-being habits, behaviors, needs, priorities, and perceptions;   
\-Better understand the prevalence and impact of mental health issues, stress, and other factors affecting students’ overall well-being;   
\-Learn what is working to help students thrive regarding health and well-being;  
\-Identify potential gaps in student health and well-being interventions, support services, and resources to inform ;   
\-Support evidence-based decision making related to health and well-being allocation of resources (positions, funding, and space) and development of campus policies and protocols;   
\-Monitor trends and changes in students’ health and well-being over time; and  
\-Inform presentations that utilize CMU student-well-being data.

What topics will I be asked about?

The HealthyU survey covers a wide range of areas including:  
  
\-Overall health and well-being  
\-Mental and emotional health  
\-Nutrition  
\-Peer support  
\-Physical health  
\-Spiritual life  
\-Stress  
\-Thriving  
\-Tobacco Use  
– Basic needs (i.e., Housing Insecurity and Technology Access)  
– Caregiving responsibilities  
  
While there are many aspects of your health and well-being that are important to Carnegie Mellon’s leadership, many of these areas are covered in other university-wide surveys as outlined in [CMU’s Six-Year Assessment Plan](https://www.cmu.edu/ira/assessment/index.html). Data from these surveys are also utilized to better understand and inform decision-making related to student health and well-being at CMU.  

Will I get anything for taking this survey? 

Students who complete a survey will be entered into a lottery to win CMU prizes (hoodies, cups, totes, hats, etc.)  
  
\-As a token of our appreciation, students who complete the survey in full will receive a CMU-Q HealthyU T-Shirt (while supplies last). Students will receive an email when the survey closes confirming their submission. This email can be used to collect their shirts from Student Affairs.  
  
– All students will also have an additional opportunity to enter a raffle for a chance to win CMU Swag during the administration period. More details will be shared in the Scoop Newsletter and digital signage.

How can I access HealthyU?

The survey can be accessed on **October 27** via the QR code or bit.ly link located on posters and digital displays across campus.  In addition, students will receive an email from Dean Dalia Atef Rehal with a link to the survey.  
  
If you access the survey via the QR code or bit.ly link, you will be asked to log into the survey using your Andrew ID. Please be assured that your individual responses will not be shared in any way that connects them to you. For further information about who can see your responses, see the next frequently asked question.   

Who can see my responses?  

CMU-Q is committed to using data to improve our own educational practice while honoring the privacy of our students. While this study is sponsored by the Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students, it is being administered by the Office of Institutional Research and Analysis (IRandA). Members of the IRandA research team will have access to your responses; however, all assessment reports and dashboards will describe students’ answers in aggregate groups or as a whole, and **will not** contain information that could allow someone to identify you. Furthermore, responses for any group that does not meet the university’s threshold for data suppression will not be shared. This helps ensure that no one can “connect the dots” and deduce who you are through indirect-identifying information.   
  
Please note, staff in the Office of Institutional Research and Analysis are bound by Carnegie Mellon’s internal data sharing and use guidelines related to student privacy and confidentiality. For more information on internal data sharing and use guidelines, please visit [Data at Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/data/index.html).

When can I take HealthyU? 

The survey will be available from October 27 until November 26, 2025.

Can I start the survey and then finish it at a later time? 

While you can begin the survey and return to it at a later time, **we encourage you to complete it in one sitting** to mitigate any potential access issues that may arise. 

Can I change my answers once my survey is submitted? 

To maintain the validity of the assessment, you cannot return to the survey and change your answers once it has been submitted.

Who do I contact if I have further questions or run into issues when taking the survey? 

You can contact Shannon Foster, senior research designer and coordinator of assessment for the Office of Institutional Research and Analysis at [slfoster@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:slfoster@andrew.cmu.edu).

Who do I contact about the resources available to me if I feel overwhelmed while I am taking the survey?

Your safety and well-being are important to us. If you feel overwhelmed at any point while taking the survey, please pay attention to your needs. **If you would like to talk with someone about issues you may experience, please contact Community and Health and Well-being at chwb@andrew.cmu.edu.** Someone will reach out to assist you.

How can I view findings from HealthyU 2023?

Insights from the 2023 findings inspired several initiatives aimed at enhancing student support and well-being. Among these were efforts to make food pantry use more accessible, create a Basic Needs Coalition to build new partnerships across campus to meet basic needs, highlight and refine existing training opportunities for the university community, and reduce barriers that make it difficult for students to find time to support their own well-being.  
To view the 2023 HealthyU Campus Community dashboard, visit the Institutional Research and Analysis website for [Research on Student Experiences](https://www.cmu.edu/ira/updated_research_student_experiences/index.html).
