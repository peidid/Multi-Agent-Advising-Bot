## Fifth Year Scholars


**Established in 1991** through a collaborative effort between students and faculty, the Fifth
Year Scholar program offers Carnegie Mellon students a unique opportunity to broaden their
intellectual pursuits beyond their standard coursework.
The program provides a tuition-free fellowship for a full fifth year of study. This enables
students to engage in enriched educational experiences and contribute meaningfully to the
CMU community through a community impact project. These projects merge academic
pursuits with metacurricular involvement to address a campus need or fulfill personal and

#### professional interests.

    involvement,

# Community Impact Project

```
Through the community impact projects, scholars contribute
meaningfully to the campus community and beyond.
Scholars have the flexibility to design a project that aligns with their
interests and expertise. Potential focus areas include:
```
- Fulfilling a campus need that directly improves the student
    experience.
- A campus-wide initiative or a program tailored to a specific
    college.
- Personal and professional development projects.
- Research-focused endeavors.
- Local community engagement that extends beyond CMU



# Academic Considerations

### Student Status: As a scholar, you'll be designated as a fifth-year senior, which

### means you'll continue to receive mailings sent to seniors, such as commencement

### information and registration materials.

### Academic Advising: Support from an associate dean or departmental

### administrator for course registration and degree requirements. Does not grant

### course registration priority.

### Degree Certification & QPA:

- Fourth Year: QPA finalized, fifth-year grades listed separately on transcript.
- Fifth Year: Allows for QPA improvement or a minor.


# Academic Considerations

**Commencement & Honors:**

- Graduate with your four-year class or defer your
    diploma until the fifth year.
- Honors: Senior research/thesis honors awarded at
    the end of the normal study period. Other honors
    are conferred with your diploma.
**Before Accepting:** Must complete a checklist with
your advisor to review your academic schedule,
course access, and community involvement plan.


# Financial Considerations

##### Financial Obligations: Scholars must pay all outstanding student account balances

##### before starting the program. Failing to do so can result in interest charges and/or a

##### financial hold.

##### Federal Financial Aid: Scholars aren't eligible for federal aid or campus work-study.

##### Your student loans may enter repayment, but you can apply for a forbearance or, in

##### some cases, a deferment to postpone payments.

##### Financial Support: You'll receive a $7,000 stipend, $3,500/semester.

##### Additional Costs: Expenses such as books and course-specific fees are the scholar's

##### responsibility.
