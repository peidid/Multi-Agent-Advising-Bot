# Study Abroad Checklist

Study Abroad experiences are those where students can study at an external university of their own choosing for a
semester and gain credit for their graduation requirements at CMUQ. These are separate from CMUQ campus exchange
programs (eg: Pittsburgh Campus Exchange) that have existing partnerships and processes in place for students from either
campus to spend a semester at the other one.

Students planning to study abroad and transfer credits back to CMUQ are required to submit a completed Study Abroad
Checklist, including all required documents listed below and signatures verifying they have attended the required meetings,
to the Coordinator for International Student Services (Student Affairs) in Qatar prior to departure. This includes students
studying abroad for summer, fall, or spring at any institution outside of Carnegie Mellon University and outside of Education
City.

# Step 1: Study Abroad Interest Meeting with the Coordinator for International Student Services

Students interested in studying abroad need to first meet with Student Affairs in CMU-Qatar – which means giving Juan
Sam a visit – to discuss the requirements and next steps, including how to research possible study abroad opportunities,
what to discuss with your advisor, understanding your funding for the study abroad semester, academic and immigration
requirements, and more. It is recommended to start your planning two semesters in advance.

# Step 2: Meet and Discuss with Academic Advisor

This is just a casual talk with your academic advisor in order to ensure that you are on the right track to be considering
going abroad for a semester. Do not think of this step lightly as it is essential for the success of your study abroad, and to
ensure that you are not harming your path to graduation by taking on such a decision.

# Step 3: Finalize Study Abroad Programs

Students must now compile a few feasible opportunities that they can pursue. Remember, CMU-Q does not currently hold
any study abroad agreements with external universities. This means the universities you research must be willing to accept
you for a study abroad as an external visiting/direct-enroll student.

Possible ways you can approach your research:

- Explore the CMU-P Study Abroad Programs page to help brainstorm some options
- Explore program providers such as CIEE, IES Abroad, etc. for study abroad programs
    o Program providers connect you with universities and programs available for study abroad
    o They offer resources, network and support and can ease the study abroad process for students
- Read through the offered course descriptions and syllabi to understand how it can fulfill your CMUQ course
    requirements

Once you compile a list, finalize the main program you wish to pursue. Make sure to understand the application
requirements and timeline set by the university you move forward with.
You can schedule a session with Juan Sam again to discuss through your options and approach a decision.


# Step 4: Complete Transfer Credit Pre-Approval Form & Meet with Academic Advisor

Students are required to complete a CMU-Q Transfer Credit Pre-Approval Form for each course they might take while
studying abroad and receive their academic advisor’s signature on each form for the courses to be approved for credit
transfer. Once you have the signed forms, submit them to qatareducationforms@andrew.cmu.edu for final approval from
the Associate Dean of Education.
The academic advisor will then submit the form to the Associate Dean of Education for final approval.

Note: If course information is unavailable, i t is recommended that you look through courses offered in the last semester or
two for the best estimate of what classes may be available for the semester in which you are enrolling. Get as many courses
pre-approved to avoid getting yourself stuck during registration week. You are expected to return with some form of official
transcript as well as the course syllabus (of the relevant semester) for all the classes taken.

Timeline note: Depending on the courses you would like to preapprove, this may take some time. In general, approval for
general education breadth and elective courses is easier to secure than asking for a substitution for a core-required course
in the major, for which a higher standard of equivalency will be required.
This is best done right after QF’s approval (or whoever is taking financial responsibility) to ensure that your efforts are not
going to waste - do make sure that you at least have an idea of what courses you will want to be taking whilst waiting for
approval. Factoring in the previous step, this point should be 2-3 weeks after midterms.

**IMPORTANT:** Please make sure you register at your home university (in this case CMUQ) for the next semester in case you
face any issues with going abroad. The worst thing that can happen is missing a semester when this could have been easily
prevented. It is advised to have a check-in with Jarrin Nevel, Academic Program Manager, to ensure your status in S3 is
updated.

# Step 5: For Students on Financial Aid: Meet with Enrollment Services

```
Students not receiving Qatar Foundation financial aid can skip to Step 6.
```
Students receiving QF grant/financial aid or scholarship are required to meet with Sheila Rian, Enrollment Services
Manager, to discuss what financial aid covers for study abroad and how the payment process will be managed with the
university you are pursuing. Email srian@qatar.cmu.edu to schedule your meeting.
Be warned that this process may be lengthy due to parties other than CMU being involved; approach this in a timely
manner and expect a wait-time of a few weeks (no less than 3) before final approval.

# Step 6: Pre-Departure Meeting with Office of Health & Wellness

Students are required to attend a pre-departure meeting with the Office of Health & Wellness to discuss health insurance
while abroad. Email Amie Rollins (amier@andrew.cmu.edu) to schedule your meeting.

Timeline note: This would best happen whilst you’re waiting for your courses to be approved. Do note that universities may
require updated vaccinations, x-rays, and other medical records, so ensure that you are well-informed on this front.

# Step 7: Pre-Departure Meeting with Office of International Education

Students are required to attend a pre-departure meeting with the Student Affairs in Qatar to submit the following
documents, review all requirements and discuss your transition abroad. E-mail cmuq-international-


education@qatar.cmu.edu to schedule your meeting.

```
Students are required to submit the following documents to the Coordinator for International Student Services in Qatar
prior to departure:
□ Study Abroad Information & Agreement Contract
□ Study Abroad Release Form
□ Study Abroad Acknowledgement of Financial Responsibility
□ Study Abroad Student Information Form: This includes uploading copies of the following documents:
□ Copy of study abroad program acceptance letter or confirmation of enrollment
□ Copy of your passport
□ Copy of the front and back of your Qatar ID
Submit this completed checklist, along with the required documents and signatures, to cmuq-international-
education@qatar.cmu.edu pr ior to departure.
