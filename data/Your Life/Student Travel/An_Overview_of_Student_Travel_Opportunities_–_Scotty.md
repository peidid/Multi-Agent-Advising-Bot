Students have a variety of options to develop their academic and leadership skills through global travel opportunities. Carnegie Mellon University Qatar values how these experiences can cultivate a global mindset through: exploring cultural competency and developing a greater understanding of cultures, perspectives and global issues. By engaging in these opportunities students can also deepen their academic understanding, gain awareness of their own cultural biases and assumptions, and integrate their travel experiences with their personal and professional goals.

#### Global Learning Trips

With a focus on the values of diversity and inclusion, impact, and creativity, Global Learning Experiences support the CMUQ Strategic Plan goals of “creating a diverse and inclusive community” and “engaging and impacting the global community.” Global Learning Trips (GLT) are interdisciplinary, 6 day trips during the academic year that are focused on a wide range of interests that engage students beyond the classroom experience.

#### Tartan Leadership & Engagement Trips

With a focus on developing leadership skills and community engagement, Tartan Leadership and Engagement (TLE) experiences support the CMUQ Strategic Plan goals of “creating a diverse and inclusive community” and “engaging and impacting the global community.” These Global Learning Experiences are focused on enhancing undergraduate leadership development through commitment to pre-travel workshops, unique experiential travel, and a commitment to serve in a leadership capacity upon their return to campus. 

#### Experiential Travel

Students can apply for or participate in 6 week-2 month summer programs and opportunities such as Technology Consulting in the Global Community (TCinGC), European Innovation Academy (EIA), Swartz Innovation Scholar, and more. Please see Lubna Barghouti for more information about experiential travel opportunities.

#### Academic Conferences & Competitions

The Office of Education encourages students to participate in competitions and conferences where they represent CMU-Q. Students may request to present their academic research once they have approval from their academic Area Head. Please see Lubna Barghouti for more information about attending an academic conference or compeititon.

#### Academic Research

By engaging in international academic research students identify how to use a scholar mindset, develop analytical skills and create scholarly work. Through the [SRI program](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/homepage/your-life-at-cmu-q/meet-the-team/student-affairs/international-education/campus-exchange/biological-sciences-summer-research-institute-sri/) or self-defined opportunities, students can engage in international summer research projects.

#### **Student Travel Opportunities & Limitations**:

Students are encouraged to plan ahead and think about how each opportunity can serve their personal and professional goals across their four years.

No student is guaranteed a global travel opportunity – students are selected based on the strength of their application for each experience. To ensure these learning experiences are available to a diverse range of our students, we limit the number of travel opportunities per student, as detailed below. Each year we review our policies, trip locations and program content to ensure we have a wide variety of opportunities that provide meaningful experiences for our students to transform into future leaders and global citizens.
