   Query: "Can I take more than the recommended number of courses in a semester?"

   Analyzing query to determine which agents are needed...

   🧠 LLM-Driven Coordination (Full Reasoning)
   📊 Priority: high
   🎯 Confidence: █████████ (0.90)

   🔍 Problem Understanding:
      • Goal: The student wants to know if they can enroll in more courses than the standard load for a semester.
      • Concern: The student may be trying to accelerate their degree completion or catch up on missed courses, and needs to understand the implications and rules regarding course overload.

   🎯 Coordination Goal:
      Provide a comprehensive response to whether the student can take more than the recommended number of courses, including policy implications and potential academic impacts.

   💭 Reasoning:
      This workflow ensures that all aspects of the student's query are addressed, from policy compliance to program-specific considerations and scheduling logistics.

   🤖 Agent Analysis:

      • policy_compliance: high priority
        → This agent is crucial because the student's query directly relates to university policies on course load and overload pe
          rmissions.

      • programs_requirements: medium priority
        → This agent can provide additional context on how taking more courses might impact the student's academic trajectory with
          in their specific program.

      • course_scheduling: low priority
        → This agent is less critical unless the student decides to proceed with an overload, in which case scheduling conflicts w
          ould need to be addressed.

      2. Tepper overload threshold: 51 units
      3. QPA requirement: 3.0 for CS, 3.5 for Tepper

   💭 Agent's Contribution:
   Yes, you can take more than the recommended number of courses in a
   semester, but it requires approval. For CS students, the full load is 54
   units for fall and spring semesters, and the overload limit is 63 units.
   To overload, you need your advisor's approval, and if you want to exceed
   the overload limit, you need the Associate Dean of Education's approval.
   You must have completed at least 45 factorable units in the previous
   semester and have a QPA above 3.0. For Tepper students, the overload
   threshold is 51 units, and you need a cumulative QPA of 3.5 to petition
   for an overload.

   💭 Agent's Contribution:
   Yes, you can take more than the recommended number of courses in a
   semester by requesting a course overload. To do this, you must consult
   with and receive approval from your academic advisor. Once approved,
   your advisor will adjust your maximum units in the registration system,
   allowing you to register for additional courses. However, this option is
   not available to first-year and transfer students in their first
   semester. Additionally, advisors can only update your maximum units
   after the Saturday following Registration Week.

   💭 Agent's Contribution:
   Yes, you can take more than the recommended number of courses in a
   semester, but it is important to consider the additional workload and
   time commitment. It might be beneficial to discuss your plan with an
   academic advisor to ensure that you can manage the increased workload
   effectively and meet all academic requirements. Additionally, some
   courses may have prerequisites or restrictions, so it's important to
   check these before enrolling in additional courses.

💡 FINAL ADVISOR RESPONSE
================================================================================

## 📌 Direct Answer (Quick Summary)
Yes, you can take more than the recommended number of courses per semester, but you need approval from your academic advisor or the Associate Dean, depending on the extent of the overload.

### Key Points
• **Approval Required:** You must get approval from your academic advisor to take more than the standard course load. For significant overloads, approval from the Associate Dean of Education may be necessary.
• **Specific Limits and Requirements:** For CS students, the standard full load is 54 units, with an overload limit of 63 units. Tepper students have an overload threshold of 51 units.
• **Academic Performance:** You need a minimum QPA of 3.0 (CS students) or 3.5 (Tepper students) to be eligible for an overload.

### Detailed Explanation
Overloading courses means taking more units than the typical full load for a semester. Each department has specific guidelines and thresholds for overloading:
- **CS Students:** The normal full load is 54 units, and you can overload up to 63 units with your advisor’s approval. If you wish to exceed this limit, you'll need the approval of the Associate Dean of Education. You must have completed at least 45 factorable units in the previous semester with a QPA above 3.0.
- **Tepper Students:** The overload threshold is 51 units, and you need a cumulative QPA of 3.5 to petition for an overload.

### What You Should Do / Next Steps
1. **Check Your Eligibility:** Ensure you meet the QPA requirement and have completed the necessary units in the previous semester.
2. **Consult Your Advisor:** Discuss your academic plan and reasons for wanting to overload. Your advisor can provide guidance and help assess if you can manage the additional workload.
3. **Obtain Approval:** If your advisor agrees, they will need to approve your course overload. For substantial overloads, additional approval from the Associate Dean may be required.
4. **Register for Courses:** Once approved, proceed with course registration, keeping in mind any prerequisites or restrictions for new courses.

By following these steps and consulting with your academic advisor, you can effectively manage an increased course load while maintaining your academic performance.

   🧠 LLM-Driven Coordination (Full Reasoning)
   📊 Priority: high
   🎯 Confidence: █████████ (0.90)

   🔍 Problem Understanding:
      • Goal: The student wants to verify if they have met the prerequisites for a specific course they are interested in taking.
      • Concern: The student is likely planning their course schedule and needs to ensure they are eligible to register for a desired course without facing administrative issues or delays.

   🎯 Coordination Goal:
      Verify if the student has met the prerequisites for a specific course.

   💭 Reasoning:
      By identifying the prerequisites for the course and comparing them with the student's academic record, we can determine eligibility for course registration.

   🤖 Agent Analysis:

      • course_scheduling: high priority
        → This agent can provide detailed prerequisites for any given course, which is directly relevant to the student's query.

      • programs_requirements: low priority
        → This agent focuses on program requirements and degree progress, which are not directly needed for checking prerequisites
          .

      • policy_compliance: low priority
        → This agent deals with university-wide policies and does not have the capability to check specific course prerequisites.
