   🧠 LLM-Driven Coordination (Full Reasoning)
   📊 Priority: high
   🎯 Confidence: █████████ (0.95)

   🔍 Problem Understanding:
      • Goal: The student wants to change their final course grade to a pass/no pass grading system using a voucher, and needs to know the process and implications.
      • Concern: The student is concerned about the impact of their course grade on their GPA and possibly their graduation timeline or academic standing.

   🎯 Coordination Goal:
      Provide comprehensive advice on using a grade change voucher for a pass/no pass grade, including eligibility, deadlines, and implications for degree progress.

   💭 Reasoning:
      This workflow ensures all aspects of the student's query are addressed, from policy compliance to program-specific implications.

   🤖 Agent Analysis:

      • policy_compliance: high priority
        → This agent is crucial as the query involves understanding and navigating university policies regarding grade changes and
           their deadlines.

      • programs_requirements: medium priority
        → Important for ensuring that changing the course grade to pass/no pass will not negatively impact the student's progress 
          in their Biological Sciences program.

      • course_scheduling: low priority
        → This agent's capabilities are not relevant to the current query as it does not involve scheduling or course content spec
          ifics.

   💭 Agent's Contribution:
   As a Biological Science student, you can use a voucher to change your
   final course grade to pass/no pass (P/NP) for Honors Modern Biology. You
   have until the last day of classes to submit your voucher for this
   purpose. However, please note that courses taken as P/NP will not count
   towards any major or minor requirements. Therefore, if Honors Modern
   Biology is a required course for your major, you would need to retake it
   for a letter grade to fulfill that requirement.

   ⚠️  Risks Identified: 1
      1. 🔴 [HIGH] Taking Honors Modern Biology as P/NP means it will not count towards major requirements, necessitating a retake for a letter grade.

   💭 Agent's Contribution:
   Yes, as a Biological Science student, you can use a voucher to change
   your final course grade to pass/no pass in Honors Modern Bio, provided
   that the Pass/Fail Grade Option Deadline has passed. You must contact
   your primary academic advisor about using a voucher no later than 12:00
   p.m. on the day prior to the last day of classes. Eligible students may
   elect to use a voucher up to and including the last day of classes each
   semester. If you pass the course with a pass/no pass election, whether
   you should retake it depends on your academic goals and requirements. If
   the course is a prerequisite or required for your major and you need a
   specific grade for future courses or programs, you may need to retake
   it. Consult with your academic advisor for personalized guidance.

💡 FINAL ADVISOR RESPONSE
================================================================================

## 📌 Direct Answer (Quick Summary)
Yes, you can use a voucher to change your final course grade in Honors Modern Bio to pass/no pass. The deadline to submit your voucher is **before 12:00 p.m. on the day prior to the last day of classes**. If Honors Modern Bio is a required course for your major, you will need to retake it for a letter grade to fulfill your major requirements.

### Key Points
• **Deadline:** Submit your voucher by **12:00 p.m. on the day before the last day of classes**.
• **Major Requirement:** If Honors Modern Bio is required for your major, a pass/no pass grade will not count, and you must retake the course for a letter grade.

### Detailed Explanation
As a Biological Science student, you have the option to change your course grade to pass/no pass using a voucher. This can be done up until the last day of classes each semester. However, it's important to note that courses taken under the pass/no pass option do not count towards major or minor requirements. This means if Honors Modern Bio is essential for your major, taking it as pass/no pass will not fulfill the requirement, and you would need to retake the course to earn a qualifying letter grade.

### What You Should Do / Next Steps
1. **Decide if Changing to Pass/No Pass is Right for You:** Consider if you need a letter grade for Honors Modern Bio for your major or future academic goals.
2. **Submit the Voucher:** If you choose to proceed, ensure you submit the voucher by the specified deadline.
3. **Plan Accordingly:** If required for your major, plan to retake the course for a letter grade in a future semester.
4. **Consult Your Advisor:** Discuss your decision and any concerns with your academic advisor to ensure it aligns with your academic and career goals.
