IS Concentrations Briefing Session - 18 Feb 2025 [Recording](https://cmu.zoom.us/rec/share/hbPF7WYnFtdgMi8pqOVwJkvOfa6h5cZ-6ojNbJeVm4ZEPR6nchv5yJNGUawzY8OU.JAFD1LPVPR7Gl6pG?startTime=1739873983000)  (Passcode: $LVv#+S4)

As an Information Systems major, you have the opportunity to tailor your academic journey by selecting a focused and specialized concentration to provide a deep dive into a subject that aligns with your passions and career aspirations. The IS Concentration gives you the agency to find your own particular area of interest within the dynamic realm of this Information Systems.

At Carnegie Mellon University, the Information Systems major is flexible and designed to help you develop your own unique interests. This is a distinctively interdisciplinary university, encouraging you to draw from many colleges and disciplines beyond your home major.

The study of Information Systems can take many paths; **Concentrations** allow you to find the path that best suits your plans and aspirations. They also allow you to establish relationships with leading researchers in your area of interest.

As part of the BSc. In Information Systems, students must complete at least one concentration.

**1- What is a concentration?**

A concentration consists of three advanced 9-unit courses (27 units) and one summative (9-units or equivalent) project course or equivalent advised research experience. Alternatively, Students may substitute an approved minor or second major for a concentration. Usually, a concentration is completed during the 3rd and 4th year of studies.

**Available concentrations:**

CMU in Qatar offers the following concentrations:

*   Data Science
    
*   Digitalization
    
*   Information Security and Privacy
    

**Minors as concentrations:**

Students may be approved to substitute a concentration by an approved minor.

The current list of CMU in Qatar approved minors as concentrations is:

*   Minor in Computer Science
    
*   Minor in Economics
    
*   Minor in Computational Biology
    
*   Minor in Technology Entrepreneurship (Only in Qatar)
    
*   Minor in Business Administration (**constrained to specific courses!** **See description in Appendix)**
    

The description of the above approved minors can be found on [Scotty](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-services/minor-information/). [](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-services/minor-information/)

[More minors and concentrations](https://www.cmu.edu/information-systems/majors-minors-concentrations.html) are approved at CMU Pittsburgh. Students interested in completing any of these minors are advised to discuss with their academic advisors as the likelihood of completing any of these minors through CMU Qatar courses, summer experiences, and Exchange semesters is improbable.

**Approved and available second majors as concentrations:**

Only an additional major in Computer Science could substitute a concentration.

**Self-defined Concentrations:**

Self-defined concentrations are not permitted.

**2- Declaration of a concentration:**

Students must declare their concentrations through [Stellic](https://academicaudit.andrew.cmu.edu/). 

*   It is highly recommended that the student discusses the concentration options with their academic advisor prior to declaring the concentration and prior to taking any course. 
    
*   **Declaration must take place by the Spring of the sophomore year** (before the registration week) to guarantee priority in the concentration courses. Changes are permitted.
    

**3- Declaration of a minor/additional major as a concentration:**

Students must declare their minor/additional major as a concentration no later than the Spring of their sophomore year before the registration week (refer to a declaration form on [Scotty](https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/academic-services/minor-information/)). 

**4- Course Double counting Policy**

The IS major allows for the following double counting rules:

*   Up to 2 courses may double count with other programs unless specified otherwise
    
*   Up to 1 course may double count with minor programs unless specified otherwise
    
*   Dietrich College General Education: Courses may double count without any limit with other programs with no restrictions
    
*   **None of the four 9-units courses of a concentration may double count with the Technical core, IS core, and IS breadth.**
    

**5- Declaration of a Summative 9-unit project course substitute**

Declaration allows the IS program to plan for the summative 9-unit project course that must be taken during the senior year of studies.

Students who plan to substitute the summative 9-unit project course must declare the substitution before taking the course and should use the form “IS Summative concentration course substitute”. 

**Permitted substitutions for the summative 9-unit project course:**

The summative 9-unit summative course should be taken after all three 9-units courses are completed. _**Exceptionally**_, when there is a consideration of graduation or course availability, a student may be permitted by their advisor to take the third 9-units course as a corequisite (in parallel) with their summative course. Completion of their concentration will be subject to successful completion of all 27 coursework units plus successful completion of the summative course.

All topics must be related to the concentration taken by the student and must be signed off upon on the IS Summative concentration course substitute Form. Supervision of a summative substitute course must include an IS Faculty supervisor and may include additional faculty members. On the form, the IS faculty supervisor must:

*   Attest that the proposed research is in line with the Concentration. 
    
*   Sign-off upon successful completion of the research.
    

The following are the permitted substitutions:

*   A _senior honors thesis_ in Information systems: the two sequence courses (66-501 and 66-502) must be completed for a passing letter grade. Dropping or turning the course to a P/NP letter grade, will lead to the student taking the summative 9-unit project course or an approved independent study. The thesis topic must be relevant to the concentration and must be approved by the concentration committee before approving the substitution.
    
*   _A 9-units independent study_ in Information Systems or in one of the domains of the minors approved as concentrations:
    
    *   The independent study should draw upon the courses taken in the concentration prior. 
        
    *   The independent study may be project oriented, while research oriented studies are preferred. Studying a new technology or going through material of an equivalent course will not be approved. The study should include a paper (reflective essay) that discusses the summative aspects of the concentration and must lead to submission of work for consideration at Meeting of the Minds.
        
    *   Independent studies can be co-supervised by non IS-faculty, but must include an IS-Faculty.
        
    *   The independent study is subject to concentration committee pre-approval.
        

Students will not be approved for a series of independent studies (6+3 units or 4.5+4.5 units, etc.). Approval will only be granted for a 1 semester 9 units independent study course. This course must be scheduled following the rules of the summative course.

**Data Science Concentration**

**Concentration Description**

Data Science is an emerging and interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge from data.  The Data Science Concentration is designed to offer an opportunity for Information Systems students to acquire data science knowledge and skills in addition to their major. 

In this concentration, students develop knowledge and skills in data analysis and visualization, database development, machine learning, and data mining. Some of these are already covered in several IS core courses. Our data science concentration offers students an advanced understanding of how to solve problems by finding new insights data of different types, formats, and sizes. The courses related to this concentration explain how data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms are key tools in this process.

**Information Security and Privacy Concentration**

**Concentration Description**

The digital age has provided society with immense affordances and efficiencies that has revolutionized how organizations and individuals function. All industries are now reliant on Information Systems for their operations and competitiveness. Data about us is kept in systems that span healthcare, banking, education, transport, retail, governmental services, and social networks – to name a few. This data is often necessary for our engagement with a world that is increasingly digitized. In such contexts, we entrust the custody of our data to organizations, who ideally utilize this data for specific purposes subject to our consent.

Nonetheless, our data in such organizations may be compromised. Proper regulations and safeguards may be inadequate, presenting opportunities for internal misuse and abuse, or external intrusion and manipulation. What technical, procedural, and regulatory safeguards are necessary to safeguard our data? What rights do we hold for our data and its privacy? Who should be held accountable when safeguards fail? What preventative, detective, and corrective measures should be put in place to mitigate risks to security and privacy in the digital age?

The Information Security and Privacy concentration exposes students to key technical, process, and regulatory dimensions related to information security and privacy. It establishes fundamental foundations for security and privacy, which are critical to all stakeholders whether individual, organizational, or governmental. The Security and Privacy concentration therefore aims to equip graduates with foundational skills in dynamic, rapidly-evolving, and essential fields for all stakeholders in the digital age.

**Career Paths**

The Security and Privacy concentration equips students with essential skills for pursuing careers as Security and/or Privacy professionals. These skills are highly sought-after in the local, regional, and global marketplaces. They include roles as:

*   Chief Security Officer
    
*   Security Analyst
    
*   IS Auditor
    
*   Information Protection Analyst
    
*   Security Architect
    
*   Audit Manager
    
*   Data Privacy Analyst
    
*   Security Administrator
    
*   Compliance Manager
    
*   IT Consultant
    

Skills in Security and Privacy are also complementary for all roles in IS.
