Did you enjoy computer science or more technical courses in high school, but are mostly interested in the practical and social applications of technology? Do you have a passion for business and want to use advanced technology to change how companies work? Do you want to learn how data and technology can be harnessed for social good?

Carnegie Mellon University's **Information Systems (IS) program****,** a joint degree program between the Heinz College and Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences is strongly technical, drawing from Carnegie Mellon’s leadership in computer science, human-centered design, business management and software engineering. It is deeply rooted in the humanities and social sciences, allowing students the lifelong benefits of a rich liberal arts education. And it provides pathways for students to find their own Information Systems niche through advanced study and research with leading researchers.  As a result, our graduates are uniquely positioned to envision and drive the positive organizational change that technology makes possible.

Do you want to use technologies like these to benefit companies, governments, and society? CMU offers the world's best undergraduate IS program and will help you do just that. In fact, many of the world-changing technologies listed above were invented here on campus—there is no better place to become a tech leader than CMU.

The field of Information Systems involves the effective design, delivery, and use of information and communications technologies to solve problems for companies, governments, and society. Equally, it is about understanding and measuring the impacts of these technologies on people and communities so they can be deployed ethically.

As an IS student, you will build a solid foundation in computing, communications, and software development. You will also study social sciences and organizational theory to develop "big picture" critical thinking and understand the human impacts of technological change. This blend prepares you to take a leading role in our digital future. The flexible nature of the program encourages students to explore their own interests through program electives, study in a contemporary concentration or through optional second majors and minors. 

IS students are well prepared to pursue graduate work in a wide range of fields. For students interested in master's degree-level graduate work at Carnegie Mellon, there are many possibilities, including accelerated Masters degree programs in Information Systems Management, Human Computer Interaction, Information Security Policy and Management, Engineering Technology and Innovation Management, and Business Administration.

IS graduates continue to be in high demand in the information-age workplace. There has been a strong job market for IS students in recent years, and national trends indicate that this is likely to continue. IS majors often take jobs in consulting companies, major software firms, large corporations, and start-up companies. Internship opportunities closely parallel the job market.

In addition to General Education Requirements and basic prerequisites in Mathematics and Computer Science, The IS program curriculum includes:

-   A broad grounding in humanities and social sciences to promote self-directed learning, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary problem-solving.
-   An Information Systems Core to provide the technology, project management, and business-facing skills needed to design and build effective real-world systems solutions.
-   An Information Systems Breadth focused on professional communications, quantitative analysis, and how technology functions in society.
-   A Concentration that gives you the flexibility and agency to gain expertise in a supporting area and define your own niche in IS.

The IS major is the perfect place for you if you are passionate about using technology for positive gains across society, both economic and humanistic.

**Study Abroad Options in Information Systems:**

Given the importance of globalization, we encourage students to consider expanding their international experience by spending a semester studying abroad. The IS program is very flexible in allowing students to pursue these opportunities. With careful planning, study abroad is possible during most semesters. Students interested in study abroad should talk with the IS Academic Advisor to help plan an appropriate course of study. With prior approval, study abroad courses may be applied to major requirements.

**Information Systems as Additional Major:**

Information Systems is not available as an additional major.
